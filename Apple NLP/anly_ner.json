      "title": "Finally, I can use my iPhone to ride the NYC subway",
      "text": "This morning, as I've done regularly since moving to New York City years ago, I left my Brooklyn apartment to head to Engadget headquarters in Manhattan. In an ideal world, I would've been able to use my iPhone to get through the turnstile at my nearby subway station. But, even though the MTA is now supporting contactless payments services such as Apple Pay , only a handful of stations and buses have so far been upgraded to the new One Metro New York ( OMNY ) system. The one close to my apartment isn't one of them. Still, I wanted to get the full experience beyond a quick demo from Apple. Thankfully, there's a subway station near our office that has the tap-to-pay turnstiles.\nBefore I get into that, though, let's first talk about the setup process for Express Transit , as the Apple Pay feature is called. When you go to \"Wallet & Apple Pay\" settings on your iPhone, you'll now see an option called Express Transit Card. After you tap on that, you need to select a credit or debit card, which will be used as default payment for your public transit rides. I already have a couple cards saved on my iPhone for use with Apple Pay, so all I had to do was choose one of them. Then, after a quick Face ID authentication, I was ready to go. The entire process took less than a minute.\nApple Pay More Once I arrived at the subway station, I just placed my iPhone next to the OMNY reader on the turnstile and then the screen displayed a message that says \"GO.\" I didn't have to open an app or unlock my phone to get through, and the same goes for the Apple Watch and Android phone with Google Pay that I tested. The fact that I didn't have to swipe my old MetroCard to try to catch a train was quite satisfying. Not only because it feels futuristic, but because it means I don't have to go to a vending machine to refill my card or worry about it getting lost or stolen.\nUnfortunately, right now the OMNY system only works for single-fare rides, but the MTA says that by the end of 2020 all types of fares will be supported, including weekly and monthly passes. The other downside at the moment, of course, is that you can't use this at every subway station or on every bus line. At launch, OMNY is only working at 16 subway stations on the 4, 5 and 6 lines between Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center (Brooklyn) and Grand Central-42nd Street (Manhattan), plus all buses on Staten Island. An MTA spokesperson told Engadget that more stations and buses will get overhauled toward the end of 2019.\nToday's OMNY launch is just the beginning of the MTA's plan to replace the use of swipeable MetroCard, a system that has been in place since 1993, by 2023 . And if you don't have Apple Pay or Google Pay, don't worry: The MTA is adamant that it is \"platform agnostic,\" so you can also use services like Samsung Pay and Fitbit Pay. Additionally, in 2021 the MTA plans to introduce its own OMNY-branded contactless transit card, in case there are NYC residents who would rather not use tech from Apple, Google and others.\nStory continues Interestingly enough, though the physical terminals were installed weeks ago, the other riders I met didn't seem aware that a new payment system was in the works. I didn't see anyone else use their smartphone or watch to pay for their ride. In fact, I let someone use one of my rides, after I had tapped my iPhone for testing purposes, and she seemed confused. When I told her I was just testing out the new MetroCard-less system, they said, \"Oh, you can do that now?\" Clearly, there's a lot of work to be done when it comes to educating the public, but perhaps now that the system is live and the turnstile screens don't just say \"COMING SOON,\" more riders will start using it.\nAs for Apple Pay in particular, the Express Transit feature is now live in Portland and here in New York, with support for Chicago's public transportation system expected to come later this year . I, for one, just wish I already had this functionality at my daily subway station. Oh, and if the MTA could figure out a way to make my train come on time every day, well, that would be great, too.",

      "text": "Deal: The Apple iPhone SE is free at AT&T by Florin Troaca / May 31, 2019, 3:54 PM Despite being 3 years old, Apple's iPhone SE remains a popular smartphone - not just because it's a well-made device that doesn't cost too much, but also because some users simply don't like the sizes that most newer handsets come in. With a screen measuring just 4 inches, the iPhone SE stands out as one of the most compact phones still on the market today. If you're in need of such a handset, you can currently get an iPhone SE 32 GB for free from AT&T - in certain conditions. Normally, the iPhone SE 32 GB costs $349 outright at AT&T. But you can get the tiny smartphone for free if you activate a new line of service on AT&T Next (for 30 months) or AT&T Next Every Year (for 24 months) and choose a plan of at least $50 per month. You will receive a full $349 discount in monthly bill credit if your line remains active for the entire term of the initial agreement. Get this AT&T iPhone SE deal here As you may know, the iPhone SE can be upgraded to the very latest version of Apple's iOS 12, so its software is way newer than its hardware. Unfortunately, at this moment, it is unclear if the handset will also get iOS 13 (which should be released later this year). In case you're not an AT&T customer and you would like to buy an iPhone SE, you should know that Apple is currently selling the unlocked version of the phone at clearance prices starting at $249. >",

      "text": "MORE Posted 17 hours ago by iClarified \u00b7 1292 views \u00b7 Translate\nApple is planning to limit third-party tracking in Kids apps, according to a report from the WSJ.Over the past few weeks the site tested 80 apps, most of which Apple promoted as 'Apps We Love'. They found that all but one used third-party trackers for marketing, ads, or analytics. They averaged four trackers each.One app, called Curious World, collected the name, age, and title of every book writer Joanna Stern's son tapped, sending that data to Facebook. CEO Abhi Arya says \"There was some rogue code in the app that was mistakenly sending this data\" and promised the info was not used by the company or Facebook.To prevent tracking of children, Apple will limit third-party tracking for apps in the Kids category, said a source. Apple wouldn't comment on this but did provide this statement...\u201cFor privacy and security reasons, Apple does not see what data users choose to share with developers and we can\u2019t see what developers do on their servers.\u201dDespite this, the WSJ notes that Apple says the second most common reason for rejecting an app is 'privacy concerns'. The company's statement continues...\u201cAs part of our ongoing efforts to make users\u2019 data even more secure, we will continue to address the challenges of improving transparency and helping users get stronger privacy and security protections for the data they\u2019ve chosen to share.\u201dWe'll likely hear more about Apple's privacy efforts at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week.",

      "text": "Written by Between 10and5 on May 31, 2019 in 10and5 , Alcohol , Entertainment , Events\nHip-hop is a gateway hustle to pretty much any industry. Rappers are always trying to expand, and sometimes, beyond music to fields like tech, film, fashion and even media. Dr. Dre\u2019s biggest deal was selling his headphone company to Apple in 2014 for $3.2 billion. Kanye West isn\u2019t just a respected rapper and producer, but also an esteemed fashion designer, having collaborated with Nike, Adidas, A Bathing Ape and a few more brands. The examples are infinite. South African hip-hop is young, but it has already produced several slashies in the form of rappers who branched into other industries or disciplines, and made a killing.\nBelow are some SA artists who branched out into film, fashion and media and became prominent figures.\nRiky Rick (Fashion)\nRiky Rick is a fashion icon. In 2017, Gucci requested his presence at Milan Fashion Week. In the same year, he became the first SA rapper to appear on the cover of GQ SA Style. Riky Rick pushes the boundaries with his dress sense\u2014his unconventional looks have had South Africans talking\u2014he has been both praised and criticised, which is the case with most fashion innovators. Riky Rick\u2019s moniker King Kotini speaks to his passion for fashion and style. His Cotton Club Records merchandise popup store attracted hundreds of young people in Braamfontein last year. To prove that his love for fashion goes beyond just rocking the most popular street and luxury brands, the artist collaborated with popular knitwear designer Laduma Ngxokolo and the brand Okapi for a line of luxury leather bags called The Capsule Collection last year.\nRouge (Film)\nRouge isn\u2019t just one of the country\u2019s finest lyricists, she also tells stories visually. After releasing her solid debut album New Era Sessions in 2017, she followed it up with a short film of the same title. The film told the story of a young woman still trying to find herself in the world. It boasted a star-studded cast that included Atandwa and Fikile Kani and Denise Zimba. New Era Sessions won Rouge the Best Micro Budget Film award at the SAFTAs. The film was directed by Rati Mofokeng, while the original concept is attributed to Rouge herself.\nSlikour (Digital Media)\nSlikour is an undoubtable pioneer, who, alongside his crew Skwatta Kamp, contributed towards South African hip-hop flourishing in the mainstream music scene the way it is today. Apart from a few singles with Skwatta Kamp, Slikour hasn\u2019t released new music in approximately a decade. But he\u2019s still a big part of the conversation in SA hip-hop. Slikour On Life , the rapper\u2019s culture and music website, is the biggest SA hip-hop site and publication. Using his knowledge of the game and leveraging his clout, Slikour created a central home for South African hip-hop fans to stay up-to-date with news and releases, and get to know their favourite artists better through in-depth interviews and podcasts. While most new media companies in South Africa are struggling to stay afloat, Slikour has an ever-growing team of young black people (mostly women) on his payroll.\nNadia Nakai (Fashion)\nNadia Nakai became the first South African woman rapper to collaborate with a big fashion retailer in her clothing line Bragga which was a partnership with Sportscene. Big fashion and retail brands have normally signed deals with either male rappers or artists and personalities from other fields.\nMoozlie (TV)\nMoozlie\u2019s career started from TV. She was a presenter at MTV Base when she decided to pursue a new venture as a rapper. She joined Cashtime Life in 2014 and became the Skhanda Queen. Moozlie, having left the label in 2016, has become one of the country\u2019s most respected rappers. She will be preforming at Castle Light Unlocks alongside J Molley, The Big Hash and Rougeon the 17th of June. Moozlie continues to be a TV presenter while still making crowds move through her bars and charismatic stage presence.\nIt\u2019s a no brainer that all of these artists have been invited to be part of Castle Lite Unlocks where all parts of hip hop are going to be highlighted as the property goes further than just the music. Castle Lite will be unlocking not only international artists like Post Malone and Meek Millbut international brands and personalities such as DM Customs, Sway Calloway to bring everything hip hop in one place.",

      "text": "0\nApple has quietly increased the limit on the size of file you can download over cellular from the App Store, iTunes Store, and more.\nThe cellular download limit is now 200MB, which means you can download an app, game, video or other file up to 200MB in size over a cellular connection. If you try to download a file that's larger, Apple will prompt you to connect to Wi-Fi in order to download your content.\nThis 200MB limit is up from the previous limit of 150MB, which had been in place since September 2017. Before that, the largest file Apple would let you download over cellular was 100MB.\nThis limit is in place to ensure that you don't accidentally download a huge game or app over your cellular connection and unintentionally blow through your entire data allotment for the month. It is nice that Apple is helping you to avoid an issue like that, but as 9to5Mac notes, many carriers now offer unlimited data plans and so it'd be nice if Apple would warn you that you're downloading a large file and then give you the option of completing the download anyway if you want to.",

Fact. Here are two more NYC life facts: I'm never not carrying multiple things in my hand, and one thing I'm always juggling is my smartphone.\nThat's why I'm ready to say goodbye to fetching my yellow MetroCard every time I use the subway or bus, and say hello to New York's contactless payment system.\nI was so ready for the changeover that I 'camped out' at Grand Central Station, as if this were an old-fashioned Apple launch, to be the first to use the MTA's now publicly launched OMNY (One Metro New York) contactless payment system today.\nUsing an iPhone XR and Apple Watch 4 to get through the Grand Central turnstile, I found it to be as seamless as it is overdue for New Yorkers.\nHere are some facts we discovered on our first contactless NYC commute. It's incredibly easy to use\nIt was hard to take a photo of the OMNY contactless payment process in action for this article simply because it happens so fast. But that's the point of it, right?\nWe didn't need to unlock and open our iPhone, or authenticate with Face ID, to pay. Just holding the back of the phone up to the newly installed turnstile screen gave us the green light to start our underground journey.\nThe thing that grabs me the most about this process is that it doesn't require people to fetch their MetroCard when we all usually have a phone in hand. I see folks paw at their purses and slim jean pockets with their one free [non-phone] hand, looking for the thin card.\nOMNY represents less juggling for those of us who see each day go by in a New York minute. Bonus points: we don't need to wastefully print out plastic MetroCards anymore. But it was also unsurprisingly late\nI got to demo the MTA's OMNY (One Metro New York) system the exact minute it went live to the public. It was, of course, a little bit late.\nIts noon launch actually happened at 12:19pm ET, and it slowly spread to all of the Grand Central turnstiles. I dashed for the first one that lit up to test it out.\nLate or not, seeing OMNY work without a hitch once the system was online was impressive. MTA workers overseeing the project were visibly excited (I even got a cheer when I went through the turnstile \u2013 again, big time Apple product launch energy).\nLondon, Chicago and other cities already have contactless systems like this installed (and have for years), so New York is late that different, too. Like we said, the transition is long overdue for the biggest transit system in the US. Using an iPhone is great, using an Apple Watch is better\nPaying with an iPhone via Apple Pay worked great. We haven't tried using Android yet, but we will next trip, and we know it works with Google Pay in similar fashion.\nThe Apple Watch is even easier when you have things in your hand (Image credit: TechRadar)\nThat said, I could see myself using the Apple Watch more regularly when carrying other things in both my hands, or rolling a suitcase with my phone in my pocket.\nAs long as you follow these directions, you won't have to double tap the Side Button: Open the Watch app on your iPhone > tap the My Watch tab > Tap Wallet & Apple Pay > then tap Express Transit Card > Select your card and authenticate with your Apple Watch with your passcode. New Yorkers are eager to use it... incorrectly\nThe entire week, I witnessed New Yorkers pressing their plastic yellow MetroCards up against the NFC reader screen... to absolutely no effect. They wanted it to work already.\nThey were even more confused when the screen went from saying 'Testing phase,' to saying 'MetroCard only' with a yellow background in the last 48 hours. To them that meant 'press your yellow MetroCard here.' It really meant, 'Keep swiping.'\nNow both of those pre-launch messages have vanished and MTA employees have been handing out OMNY explainer pamphlets to people. But now that things work, everyone seem to know what to do. Officially on 4-5-6 trains, secretly works elsewhere\nHere's something that wasn't announced, but we discovered today: it works on more subway lines than the MTA announced \u2013 if the 4-5-6 runs through the same station.\nThe dedicated 7 train entrance in Grand Central also works with OMNY (Image credit: TechRadar)\nOfficially, it works on the 4-5-6 subway between Grand Central and Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center and Staten Island buses. For our second test, we used it on the 7 train at Grand Central (even the dedicated 7 train entrance worked flawlessly for us).\nIn other words, even if you don't use the 4-5-6 subway, there's a chance you could still take advantage of using your iPhone or Android to pay for your subway ride on a nearby track. The OMNY rollout is a lot bigger than anyone first expected. But it's mostly for tourists and one-off riders today\nToday is the beginning of the end of the MetroCard, but local New Yorkers with daily commutes may not be using it often because discounts fares don't apply.\nIt's meant for one-off full fares: $2.75. Commuters won't be able to add time (weeks or months) in 2019, and multiple ride discount seekers won't find any small savings.\nLikewise, riders with disabilities will have to stay on the MetroCard, according to the MTA. Discounted rides via OMNY are a 2020 thing, alongside the system's more widespread rollout.\nImage credit: TechRadar You'll need iOS 12.3, but can't use iOS 12.4 beta\nI had to roll back to iOS 12.3.1 to add Express Transit to my default credit card within the Wallet app. The Express Transit settings menu option vanished in iOS 12.4 beta.\nThat should change at WWDC 2019 should Apple officially launch iOS 12.4. Hopefully it remains an option if developers upgrade to the iOS 13 beta next week, too. I ended up spending $16.50 to bring you this article\nOops. This article cost more than I anticipated simply because we have to tap our devices multiple times to get multiple photo, video and the full experience.\nThe OMNY reader does provide ample time for you to get through the turnstile, but it also does eventually time out (it seems like a minute and a half if you don't go through the turnstile). That's important information to mention, and my noting it means I can write this off... hopefully. ",

      "text": "This is a great answer, but for some reason the author left out the most obvious of reasons. Mini-USB put the mechanical strain of the connection on the socket side, while Micro-USB puts that strain on the cable side. Since its much easier to toss a cable vs remove and solder in a new socket connector the average cycle lifetime became much less critical in general.",

The document also provides alternatives for for file access, screen sharing, and remote desktop access. Apple doesn\u2019t give a reason for canning the service. Currently, if you have an iCloud account, you can use Back to My Mac to connect to your other Macs over the Internet. You can use Screen Sharing to control the remote computer from anywhere you are connected to the Internet. You can also share files between computers, including files that aren\u2019t stored in iCloud Drive (such as files in your Downloads, Movies, and Pictures folders). First you set up Back to My Mac on each computer, and then you can connect from one Mac to the others. Do the following on each computer you want to use with Back to My Mac.",

      "text": "/ Dennis Sellers As noted by 9to5Mac , Apple has increased the cellular download limit for iPhone and iPad that prevents users from downloading large files from Apple\u2019s stores, including apps, games, video podcasts, iTunes Store films and more. It\u2019s been increased from 150 MB to 200 MB. This means users can now download more apps and games over cellular networks. Of course, 200MB still isn\u2019t that much storage. Here\u2019s a workaround that I think will work: If you try to download an app bigger than 200MB, the app icon will appear on your home screen until you connect to Wi-Fi. When the icon appears, open the Settings app on your iOS device. Navigate to General > Date & Time, and toggle \u201cSet Automatically\u201d to off. Tap the Date and move the date forward by 2-3 days.then tap General again. Once the App Store dialogue pops up asking you to Retry the download, select that option and you will now notice that the application downloads over a cellular data connection. After you\u2019ve adjusted the date, you may have to wait before the download is initiated.",

      "text": "/ Dennis Sellers Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference kicks off today with a keynote event at 10 a.m. (Pacific). Following is what I\u2019m expecting to see announced during the keynote. There\u2019s a 99.99% chance we\u2019ll see the next generations of macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS announced. If this doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019ll swear off ice cream. And I LOVE ice cream. I also expect to see the long-awaited modular Mac Pro announced, along with the rumored 31-inch Apple display. Whether they\u2019ll be available this week is a question mark. However, I think the display will be available within a week to 10 days as it should be a great fit for the 2018 Mac mini and the just-updated MacBook Pros. A few weeks ago, I thought we\u2019d see the rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro unveiled at WWDC. However, since Apple surprised us with an MB Pro update on May 21 , I expect the super-sized laptop won\u2019t arrive until spring 2020. Also, since the iMac was updated on March 19 , don\u2019t expect the standard all-in-one to see any sort of update next next spring, as well. An upgraded iMac Pro could be unveiled this week, but, if the new Mac Pro is announced or previewed, I don\u2019t think Apple will want its pro all-in-one stealing the Mac Pro\u2019s spotlight. As for new iPads and iPad Pros, those probably won\u2019t arrive until September and October, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 5 also isn\u2019t likely until post-summer. Ditto any new, revamped HomePods. If Apple is planning an update of the Apple TV set-top box, that probably won\u2019t be announced until the Apple TV+ streaming service arrives this fall. Those are my predictions. Come back at 10 a.m. (Pacific) to see how clear or cloudy my crystal ball is.",

Photo: Tommy Daniel | Creative Commons | CC BY-NC 4.0\nWhen it comes to breaking into a phone, the police and the vast majority of security researchers agree that Android phones are increasingly becoming more secure and difficult to hack into compared to an iPhone.\nAccording to multiple police warrants and security sources, Android phones are starting to level to the security level of Apple\u2019s phones and breaking in Google\u2019s OS phone becomes increasingly trickier than it used to be.\nIn one warrant , cops seized an LG Android phone after swooping on a suspected drug dealer, Angel Angul, who was allegedly selling methamphetamine to an undercover police officer. The phone was found in the suspect Ford Mustang, but no other details were given concerning the exact model of the evidence phone. Back in January, when the investigation on Angulo started, the police obtained permission to bypass the security features in the phone by holding it up against the suspect\u2019s face or by depressing his fingerprint to unlock the phone using facial and fingerprint recognition technology.\nHowever, all these efforts did not come into a favorable outcome.\nAccording to the investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), they were not able to crack the phone\u2019s security mechanisms, even at the screen lock level, using the sophisticated forensic hacking tools that they currently have. As a consequence of their inability to bypass the phone\u2019s security system, they have asked the Justice Department for an extension of until 120 days to give them more time to open the device.\nIndeed, the security mechanisms in an Android phone has become too strong that in some cases, even the police could not crack the code, and the forensic community agrees.\n\u201cSome would say iPhones are less secure,\u201d said one source from a large forensics provider.\nVladimir Katalov, CEO of Russian forensics provider Elcomsoft, told Forbes that there is evidence that Google, just like Apple, has been adding security features in Android phones continually making it very secure to prevent unauthorized access to the said phones.\nSecure Startup, Android security feature that encrypts the contents of the phone and only allows people with the passcode or some other types of authorization like a fingerprint or facial recognition to access the internal storage of the device is one of the most successful security updates that Google implemented in their Android OS-run phones.\nThe fact that Android license multiple brands to use the OS in different ways add up the mystery for law enforcement, or even hackers, to penetrate a phone without the owner\u2019s authorization. Unlike iOS that is exclusively used by Apple products like iPhones and iPads and can be hacked with a unified method (even if hacking it takes so much research, skills, and resources as Apple updates the OS regularly), Android\u2019s security system process varies from one manufacturer to another. Bypassing LG\u2019s lock screen could need different techniques used in avoiding Samsung\u2019s lock screen mechanism.\n\u201cWhile some Android phones can be accessed using generic methods, each new model may contain unique features which require a more customized approach,\u201d said Peter Sommer, professor of digital forensics at Birmingham City University in the U.K. \u201cIn addition there are instances of standard Android phones being heavily modified to have secure features.\u201d\nWhile the government has considerably spent a hefty amount of money in trying to hack iPhones, they seem to have forgotten that Android phones also become more and more secure. A recent $1.2 million purchase was made by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a technology that would essentially hack into a locked iPhone , but evidence shows that there is no improvement on the technological infrastructure that the police use to forensically get into an Android device.\nNonetheless, iPhones still overpowers Android security in some cases, though. Security researchers have agreed that there is a considerable disparity in Android\u2019s facial recognition systems across different devices. News broke out that some Android phones can be unlocked by only using the owner\u2019s photo in another device. When Forbes tested some Android devices\u2019 facial recognition, a 3D printed head was able to open all the tested units without any problems.\nIn the end, amidst claims of iPhone\u2019s impenetrability and Android\u2019s disparities in terms of its facial recognition system, Google continues to work to improve their devices\u2019 security and they might come a little bit over-secured in the future that sweeping through a suspect phone will no longer be an option for law enforcement to find evidence from.

We reported earlier today that plans are on to curb exports of rare earth minerals to the United States if the need arises, and now, reports have emerged that a more stringent actions against US firms with business interest in China is on the way.\nSimilar to US Commerce Department \u201c Entity List \u201d that bans Huawei and other Chinese firms from doing business with US firms, a statement from China\u2019s Commerce Ministry says arrangement are on to establish an \u201cunreliable entity list\u201d which would blacklist foreign companies, individuals and organizations that violate local market rules.\nGao Feng, a spokesman of China\u2019s commerce ministry, had this to say on the matter (via TechCrunch ):\nForeign enterprises, organizations, or individuals that do not comply with market rules, deviate from a contract\u2019s spirit, or impose blockades or stop supplies to Chinese enterprises for non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be included on a list of \u2018unreliable entities.\u2019\nShould the so called entity list come to fruition, it is not certain which firms and what limitations will be placed on firms that will eventually make the list. Though it is a common knowledge that the list will include U.S firms, and perhaps firms from countries that have since complied with U.S ban on Huawei and other Chinese firms.\nWe would have to wait for the exact details of the plan, since the spokesman of China\u2019s commerce ministry has yet to further comment on the details, and at what time the list will come to light.

      "text": "May 31, 2019 628 Views With the rise of Chinese smartphone brands, Apple, Samsung, and other top brands have experienced rapid diving in sales in China. Apple\u2019s strategy for smartphones has changed a lot. So we are expecting more changes not only on the market but in the overall industry. Foxconn has always been the \u2018base camp\u2019 for most of the smartphone manufactures. It has invested heavily in the United States and India, which means that this manufacturer will also transfer the Apple production line out of China, and Apple will gradually withdraw from the Chinese market. Also Read : Xiaomi Foxconn Factory Line: How Is Xiaomi Mi 9 Phone Produced? In fact, Foxconn\u2019s overseas cooperation with Apple to invest heavily in the establishment of production lines has become a more concerned issue for domestic Foxconn employees. After all, it is the world\u2019s largest electronics OEM, producing the world\u2019s top high-tech electronic products. The annual workload is as high as one million. It is said that there are about 500,000 Foxconn workers in Shenzhen. In this regard, the founder and chairman of Foxconn, Guo Taiming also said that if Foxconn gradually withdraws from China, a large number of employees will lose their jobs. After all, because this manufacturer has a large number of employees, it will further affect the development of other companies. Apple supply chain will also have problems, which is not a good phenomenon for Apple, China, and Foxconn. There will be a large number of people who have nowhere to go, even the work of Foxconn employees\u2019 families will be affected, increasing the unemployment rate of the population, which is likely to lead to a big tilt in the market. On April 15, Bloomberg reported Foxconn will transfer the production of iPhone to India. Guo Taiming said that he was also invited by Indian Prime Minister Modi and in the future, \u2018they will play a very important role in the smartphone industry in India, and we have moved the production line to India.\u2019 It must be said that Apple and Foxconn complement each other and indeed further promote the maturity of the Chinese smartphone industry. However, the trend of future sales of Apple in China seems to have determined to a large extent whether Foxconn continues to invest heavily in overseas construction. Many believe that Foxconn will leave sooner or later because China\u2019s future development will not rely on labor-intensive industries such as Foxconn. In the future, China will enter the middle and high-end manufacturing sector, and they need to attract more high-end manufacturing industry. Therefore, in the long run, Foxconn\u2019s withdrawal from China will have a little impact on Chinese manufacturing. However, in terms of short-term impact, if this company moves away, it will mean that a large number of workers will become unemployed.",

      "text": "By Lisa Marie Segarra May 31, 2019\nLoot boxes have successfully evaded regulation from the U.S. government, so far. But as the video gaming transaction rises in popularity, it has found itself faced with a new, possibly more powerful opponent: Google .\nThe search engine giant and overseer of Android phones\u2019 software has decided to make games that offer loot boxes in its Google Play Store disclose their odds. Apple made a similar move with its App Store back in 2017.\nLoot boxes\u2014sometimes called loot crates\u2014operate by offering a player a chance to get in-game items. They can either be weapons to use in a game, skins the players can equip their characters with, or other items, like power-ups. While many games have some form of in-game transaction that unlock specific items or new areas, loot boxes typically randomize the experience, allowing players to get some collection of items, but not revealing exactly what items are included.\nTake gaming phenomenon Fortnite . Before it joined the mobile gaming world, the massive, multi-player shooter featured loot boxes in its Save the World co-op mode. It was sued over the loot crate practices, leading publisher Epic to provide a more transparent buying experience. Now Fortnite offers battle passes, which allow players to get a bundle of items, rather than buying each one individually. They also get to see exactly what they\u2019re paying for.\nPurchasing a random collection of items with unknowable odds has put loot crates in the spotlight, with many calling it a form of gambling. The issue first gained attention in late 2017, around the release of the game Star Wars Battlefront II.\nThe inclusion of the loot boxes in the Disney-owned, EA-developed title created a massive uproar throughout the already vocal gaming community. While not the first time a game featured the loot box model, the Star Wars title was the first time it garnered significant attention. Eventually the game dramatically overhauled its approach to loot boxes, and it\u2019s since become common for a publisher to announce that upcoming games would not feature loot boxes.\nIn order for a game to be considered gambling, it needs consideration (which means a purchase or monetary buy-in of some kind), a prize, and an element of chance. Because they are randomized, loot crates clearly have the element of chance, and unless they can be earned through gameplay, they require that players purchase them with money\u2014whether it\u2019s real or in-game currency.\nThe question of whether loot boxes constitute gambling mostly depends on if their digital contents are a \u2018prize.\u2019 In terms of gambling, prizes are something of value, and there has yet to be a consensus on whether in-game items have worth in the real world, because they only exist digitally and can\u2019t be used elsewhere. Some argue that people\u2019s willingness to spend money\u2014be it directly or indirectly through in-game currency\u2014proves they have inherent value.\nBeyond Google\u2019s move, there\u2019s a bill making its way through Congress that would ban the sale of loot boxes to minors. The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act would regulate games that both target minors and employ pay-to-win mechanics.\nWhile regulation against loot boxes in video games hasn\u2019t completely caught on in the U.S., other countries have taken them on in various ways. In 2017, China required companies to disclose the odds of winning items, similar to Apple and Google\u2019s approach. And in 2018, Belgium officially labelled loot crates as a form of gambling. As a result, game companies have either removed loot boxes from their titles, or removed the games entirely from the country\u2019s market. In addition, the Netherlands made transferable items\u2014digital goods that could be transferred to other players or exchanged for currency, for example\u2014illegal, after a 2018 study was released.\nWith video games mostly associated with consoles and PCs, Google and Apple may not be the most obvious loot crate fighters. But, increasingly, developers are formatting existing games or franchises for mobile, or creating new games entirely for the platform. And as mobile gaming continues its fast growth, the tech giants are clearly deciding to step in and police their own platforms. It\u2019s a smart play, because government regulators will have the next turn, and they may declare that it\u2019s game-over for in-app gaming purchases. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT",

      "text": "Apple is shutting down iTunes The iconic platform was first launched in 2001 on May 31, 2019, 4:59pm Apple iTunes 2019\nAfter nearly 20 years, Apple is saying goodbye to iTunes. The company is expected to soon shut down the multimedia platform and unveil a line of replacement apps.\nAccording to Bloomberg , Apple\u2019s decision to discontinue iTunes is part of a larger strategy regarding its various media arms. Apps for Music, TV, and Podcasts are already featured on iPhones and iPads; Mac and MacBook computer users will now have access to them. Apple iTunes logos through the years\nThe idea of centralizing all its content into a singular iTunes space may have sounded good in theory at one point. However, as Apple\u2019s offerings have grown and diversified, iTunes only grew to become harder and harder to navigate. Breaking down each facet of iTunes into separate apps solves that issue.\nApple\u2019s decision to focus on individual media apps also makes sense considering its expansion plans. Now more than just a software and computer manufacturer, the tech company has steadily crossed over into the entertainment content business. Apple not only operates its own online radio network, but come the fall, will also have its own TV streaming platform .\nBloomberg reports that Apple will reveal the new replacement apps on Monday at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose.\nToday\u2019s news comes just a few days after Apple announced its first iPod in four years .

      "text": "https://marketingland.com/heres-how-to-stand-out-in-a-crowded-streaming-service-market-261909\nYou can hardly avoid facts that make you feel your age these days \u2013 I realized the other day there are people that are legal adults who have no idea that Netflix used to send you DVDs in the mail. Before becoming the most popular over-the-top (OTT) streaming service on earth, with almost 150 million global subscribers, it helped bridge the gap between the days of heading down to the local video store, and the way we consume media today. Many have tried to follow in Netflix\u2019s footsteps and with so much choice, audiences have become ever more fickle and impatient. They want the best possible content at the lowest cost, and they want it available 24/7.\nThis year is set to be particularly crowded in the OTT subscription market, with Disney+, Apple TV+ and Britbox all launching to join Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, Roku, Hulu, HBO Go\u2026the list goes on. So, when launching a product like this, how can brands ensure they stand out from the (jam-packed) crowd?\nToday I\u2019ll be reviewing some of the key learnings we\u2019ve acquired at my employer, Merkle, when marketing these kinds of services, many of which can be applied across a range of other verticals.\nExploring niche audiences\nUnlike your internet or gas provider, streaming services have the unusual quality that users or households may choose more than one. In fact, a compelling argument for many of these big brands setting up new services is that almost half of UK households have more than one streaming video-on-demand (SVOD) subscription, and that number of multi-subscription households is growing each year. So knowing this, you might assume a prime audience for your new service is people that are already subscribed to another.\nBut let\u2019s think about that compelling argument for a second. Netflix is king, so that\u2019s likely streaming service number one in a lot of those cases. And number two? Amazon Prime. With 75 million global subscribers it\u2019s a not-very-close second. But arguing that so many households have more than one streaming service means they clearly don\u2019t mind paying twice, is ignoring Amazon Prime\u2019s other purpose. Prime Video comes with an Amazon Prime subscription. The incredibly popular membership which means next-day delivery on millions of Amazon\u2019s products. Speaking purely for myself, I\u2019ve been a Prime member for almost a year (people finally got sick of me asking to use theirs for deliveries) and have never once logged into Video. While I\u2019m just a focus group of one and I\u2019m sure many Prime users do choose to take advantage of the added bonus of instant video alongside speedy delivery, it\u2019s difficult to know how many \u201cdouble streamers\u201d would have chosen that second service for the video content alone.\nThat\u2019s not to say people aren\u2019t willing to pay for more than one service or that you should exclude current SVOD subscribers from your targeting, but you cannot rely on them alone. Instead, it\u2019s important to identify other relevant, niche audiences that will respond to specific USPs. The best way to do this is by analyzing your first-party data, but short of having any (what with being a brand new service), there are a host of audience insight tools available such as Hitwise or Mintel that help you dive a bit deeper.\nEach of the SVOD services available today and being released this year have something unique to offer users, and they need to make sure that they\u2019re promoting that message to the right audience. Simply saying \u201chere\u2019s another streaming service to add to your list\u201d will not be good enough.\nApp-install formats\nWhile it might seem obvious that to get people using a streaming app, you should be putting some budget behind app install formats, what we\u2019ve learned at Merkle is that particularly for a launch, that\u2019s where the vast majority of budget needs to go.\nLast year when launching a new sports streaming app, we\u2019d originally planned for most of the budget to go behind ads leading to the website. Our thinking is that as this is a new product, users would want an opportunity to find out more about the brand before signing up to a free trial, and of course, eventually downloading the app. But we very quickly had to pivot our strategy as we found this was falling short of our free-trial targets. Instead, we started to plow around 80% of budget behind the variety of app-install formats available across our digital channels such as:\nGoogle app campaigns: Single campaigns that run across search, Google Play, YouTube and the Google Display Network. They\u2019re easy to set up as they use text and assets from your app store listing to compose ads and run with automatic bidding and targeting. The disadvantage is you have limited control over where your ads appear so negative keyword and placement lists are vital. Facebook app install ads: Ads that can run across Facebook, Instagram and the Facebook Audience Network, linking directly to your app listing. With 70% of traffic on Facebook is mobile, it\u2019s a fantastic way to reach users when they\u2019re in \u201capp download mode.\u201d However, it\u2019s a good idea to complement these ads with some targeting desktop and leading to your website, so that the remaining 30% of users aren\u2019t excluded. DV360 mobile campaigns: More recently, the ability to promote apps through DV360 has been released. Simply create a new line item and select \u201cMobile app install,\u201d and you can choose the same kinds of targeting you would for any of your other campaigns in the platform.\nWhen running any of these formats, it\u2019s vital to have pixels in place to track who has downloaded the app. Not only to be able to report on performance, but also to build an audience of app downloaders that you can then exclude from these campaigns. Otherwise, you risk wasting money on users that have already taken your desired action.\nAutomation and personalization\nOne thing all SVOD services have in common is a lot of content. Some more than others, but we\u2019re talking thousands of combinations of shows, actors and genres per platform. Even for the likes of Apple and Disney, their brand name alone is not going to be enough to convince people to take out a new or second subscription. Instead, they need to effectively promote their content at scale, and to the right audiences. Automation and personalization are vital for this.\nThere have been huge developments in automation across digital platforms in the last few years, which has eased the burden of manual labor when marketing extensive inventory like this. A handful of successful tactics tried and tested at Merkle are:\n1. Inventory management\nAvailable in Search Ads 360, inventory management uses a product feed, ad templates and rules to automatically build out hundreds, if not thousands of keywords, ad variants and extensions for search campaigns. In a fraction of the time that a manual build would take, you can have full coverage for every show and actor featured in your inventory, meaning you can serve highly relevant ads for even the most granular, niche searches. After building inventory management campaigns for an SVOD client last year, we saw a 59% reduction in CPA within three months.\n2. Dynamic creative\nDynamic creative is something retailers, in particular, familiar with when retargeting users with specific products that have been viewed on site. But it can also be utilized for prospecting. Templates built in Google Studio can pull different ad components such as logos, show names, etc., from a feed to create multiple ad variants. These different variants can be run in rotation and optimized towards best performers over time. Or, you can layer over targeting to serve relevant ads to certain users with no manual build work. For a sports streaming service, we used geotargeting and audience segmentation to identify fans of particular football clubs and served them ads showing their team logo and upcoming fixtures. This achieved a 22% reduction in cost-per-free-trial compared to non-dynamic creative\n3. Optimization rules on social\nFacebook was a little behind the other half of the duopoly in terms of automation, but last year, they released automated rules within Ads Manager. These rules can monitor the performance of campaigns and ad sets and make automatic changes based on parameters that you set. For instance, we\u2019ve created rules to increase bids on any ad sets that have led to more than X number of conversions below our target CPA. This means we\u2019re able to react in real time to changes in performance without constant manual monitoring, driving the best possible performance from campaigns. This was particularly useful over weekends when launching new content, as naturally fewer people are in the office, and overall we saw a 60% reduction in cost-per-free-trial through social utilizing these rules.\nRetention strategies\nSo your acquisition campaigns have been a huge success. You\u2019ve met your app download and free trial targets \u2013 what\u2019s next? Well, you\u2019re not even close to the finish line. It\u2019s important to have retention strategies in place from day one to make sure that acquisition translates into lifetime value.\nNinety percent of apps downloaded today are never opened again. To avoid ending up in the \u201cscrAppheap,\u201d create remarketing lists of users that have downloaded the app but not started their free trial and target them with app engagement campaigns. They aren\u2019t going to remember it\u2019s there by themselves; you need to provide that reminder.\nAs for users that have started their free trial, don\u2019t let them slip away at 29 days. Make sure that when their free trial is about to end, they are reminded of some great content they haven\u2019t explored yet, or maybe the option to refer a friend for a reduced price for a month. All too easily people jump from one free trial to another, so don\u2019t assume that you\u2019ll keep them as a customer without some investment.\nFinal thoughts\nStreaming has revolutionized our media consumption, and the market is likely to get even more cluttered over the next few years. Users will not be willing to pay for a never-ending list of subscriptions, but there can be room in the market for a new service that taps into the right audience with relevant USPs, and strong marketing tactics.\nThe post Here\u2019s how to stand out in a crowded streaming service market appeared first on Marketing Land.

The most significant update will likely be the ability for iPad apps to run on the Mac. Visit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\nIf there\u2019s one theme that seems to be driving Apple\u2019s approach toward its Mac software, it\u2019s bringing popular mobile features to its desktop operating system.\nApple is expected to debut its next major Mac operating system update during its Worldwide Developers Conference conference on Monday, and reports indicate it will include some iPhone and iPad-centric features. The biggest of these is said to be the ability to run iPad apps on Apple\u2019s desktop computers.\nApple will likely provide a preview of the software on Monday before launching the new update in the fall, as it has done in years past.\nHere\u2019s a look at what we\u2019re expecting to see from the update, which will presumably be called macOS 10.15. Developers will be able to make iPad apps that run on the Mac.\nSoon enough, you may be able to run iPad apps on your Mac laptop or desktop. The move, reportedly called \u201cMarzipan\u201d internally, will enable developers to write apps for both operating systems using the same code, according to Bloomberg.\nApple previously mentioned the effort in a presentation at last year\u2019s WWDC, and news of the project was reported by Bloomberg as far back as 2017.\nIt would be a significant change that could make both the iPad and Apple\u2019s Mac computers more useful. Apple has been pushing the iPad as being a productivity tool ever since it launched its larger-screened iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.\nBut one of the biggest criticisms in using the iPad in place of a laptop is that the software isn\u2019t as well-optimized for certain tasks as desktop operating systems. Allowing developers to easily create apps for both could potentially change that.\nIt also echoes the approaches taken by Microsoft and Google with their mobile and desktop products. Developers can write apps that work across Windows 10 tablets and laptops, and Google has made its mobile Android apps compatible with Chromebooks in recent years. Apple will bring more of its mobile apps to the Mac, too.\nApple will also reportedly bring a handful of its own iPhone and iPad apps to the Mac with the macOS 10.15 update, according to Bloomberg. These could include: The Podcasts app. A new app debuting in iOS 13 that merges Find My Friends and Find My iPhone. An updated version of the Reminders app that will also be launching in iOS 13. An refreshed version of Apple\u2019s Books app. That includes a new Apple Music app.\nMacOS 10.15 is expected to include a new Apple Music app, according to 9to5Mac and Bloomberg.\nThe design for this new app will be based on iTunes, and it\u2019s expected to feature similar user interface elements such as a gray side menu where options like the \u201cFor You\u201d section and \u201cBrowse\u201d feature are located, as leaked screenshots published by 9to5Mac indicate. And the new Apple TV app.\nApple said in March that its new Apple TV app will debut on the Mac this fall, which means there\u2019s a good chance it will be included in macOS 10.15.\nThe new app, which is already available on Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad, brings a handful of changes, the biggest of which being the ability to subscribe to specific channels like HBO and Starz, from within the app. The app has also received a cosmetic redesign that brings deeper personalization.\nOther iPhone features are expected to make their debut on the Mac as well.\nApple is also expected to bring other recently-introduced iPhone features to the Mac this fall, according to Bloomberg. These include: Screen Time, the feature Apple introduced in iOS 12 that helps users mange how much time they\u2019re spending on their iPhone. Siri Shortcuts, another recently-added capability that enables Siri to serve up suggestions based on your usage habits and streamline tasks. iMessage stickers. You\u2019ll also be able to use your iPad as a second display for your Mac.\nSoon enough, you may be able to re-purpose your iPad as a secondary display for your Mac, as 9to5Mac reports that such a feature could be coming in macOS 10.15.\nYou can already do this with third-party apps like Luna Display and Duet Display, but it sounds like this will soon be supported natively. You\u2019ll be able to use your Apple Watch to authenticate actions on the Mac.\nIn addition to unlocking your Mac via your Apple Watch, macOS 10.15 could make it possible to perform other actions when the wearable is within range, according to 9to5Mac. It\u2019s unclear exactly what those actions will be, but one sensible use case would be the authentication of Apple Pay purchases. Related Posts:",

      "text": "Text Input: To prepare for superfast 5G, Apple bumps iOS App Store download limit to a ridiculous 200 MB May 31, 2019 at 21:00 GMT 1 day ago\nOne of the most annoying limitations built into iOS is the difference between cellular and WIFI data, with strict download limits in place on cellular data, meaning until recently the App Store on the phone refused to download apps more than 150 MB big. The Facebook app is 260 MB and many games are closer to a GB.\nIn these days of 4G data (and 5G already here for some) and data plans measured in 10\u2019s of GB that is, of course, laughable, and Apple has finally responded by increasing the limit a massive 33%, to 200 MB.\nHopefully, Apple will someday think different and offer its phone users a little bit more freedom and control over their experience. After all, it\u2019s their phone, not Apple\u2019s.",

      "text": "Share Our extensive research has shown that imitating the smart money can generate significant returns for retail investors, which is why we track nearly 750 active prominent money managers and analyze their quarterly 13F filings. The stocks that are heavily bought by hedge funds historically outperformed the market, though there is no shortage of high profile failures like hedge funds\u2019 2018 losses in Facebook and Apple. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what the funds we track think about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in this article. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is the 3rd most popular stocks hedge funds at the end of March (see the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds ). Hedge fund sentiment towards AMZN is still near its all time high that was reached at the end of 2018. To most shareholders, hedge funds are viewed as underperforming, outdated investment vehicles of the past. While there are over 8000 funds trading today, Our researchers hone in on the aristocrats of this club, about 750 funds. It is estimated that this group of investors handle the lion\u2019s share of the hedge fund industry\u2019s total capital, and by observing their inimitable picks, Insider Monkey has brought to light a number of investment strategies that have historically exceeded the S&P 500 index. Insider Monkey\u2019s flagship hedge fund strategy surpassed the S&P 500 index by around 5 percentage points annually since its inception in May 2014 through the end of May. We were able to generate large returns even by identifying short candidates. Our portfolio of short stocks lost 30.9% since February 2017 (through May 30th) even though the market was up nearly 24% during the same period. We just shared a list of 5 short targets in our latest quarterly update and they are already down an average of 11.9% in less than a couple of weeks whereas our long picks outperformed the market by 2 percentage points in this volatile 2 week period. Let\u2019s take a gander at the key hedge fund action surrounding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). What have hedge funds been doing with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)? At Q1\u2019s end, a total of 166 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -1% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in AMZN over the last 15 quarters. With hedge funds\u2019 positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few noteworthy hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions). According to Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database, Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group has the number one call position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), worth close to $5.2213 billion, comprising 2.6% of its total 13F portfolio. On Citadel Investment Group\u2019s heels is Fisher Asset Management, managed by Ken Fisher, which holds a $2.4344 billion position; the fund has 3.3% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock. Remaining professional money managers that hold long positions comprise Boykin Curry\u2019s Eagle Capital Management, Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Stephen Mandel\u2019s Lone Pine Capital . Because Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced a decline in interest from the smart money, it\u2019s safe to say that there were a few money managers that decided to sell off their full holdings by the end of the third quarter. Intriguingly, Daniel Sundheim\u2019s D1 Capital Partners cut the biggest position of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, totaling close to $426.3 million in call options, and Andrew Hahn\u2019s Ursa Fund Management was right behind this move, as the fund sold off about $300.4 million worth. These transactions are interesting, as total hedge fund interest fell by 2 funds by the end of the third quarter. Let\u2019s now review hedge fund activity in other stocks \u2013 not necessarily in the same industry as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B ), and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). This group of stocks\u2019 market valuations match AMZN\u2019s market valuation. Ticker No of HFs with positions Total Value of HF Positions (x1000) Change in HF Position",

The Facebook app is 260 MB and many games\u2026",

      "text": "Your iPhone just got marginally more powerful, as 9to5Mac reports that Apple quietly increased its cellular download limit from 150MB to 200MB this week. If you aren\u2019t connected to Wi-Fi when you start downloading an app, movie, or podcast on your iOS device, it will check to see how large the file is. Previously, if a file was over 150MB, it would fail to download without connecting to Wi-Fi. But now the limit has been increased.\nThe cellular download limit makes sense on paper, as it stops unwitting users from downloading massive files and using up all of their monthly data on accident. On the other hand, the data limit is inexplicably impossible to override, so even if you recognize the risks and want to download the app or video anyway, you\u2019ll have to wait until you can find a Wi-Fi network. Even more baffling is the fact that wireless subscribers with unlimited data plans are restricted to the same data limit as everyone else, despite it serving them no purpose.\nThis would perhaps be an easier pill to swallow if Apple increased the limit on a regular basis, but as 9to5Mac points out, this is the first time the limit has changed since 2017 when it jumped from 100MB to 150MB.\nSo while it\u2019s not the most exciting news ahead of WWDC 2019 next week, it will be a welcome change for unlimited data customers who want a little bit of extra wiggle room for their over-the-air downloads. And with 5G right around the corner, perhaps a more substantial data limit will roll out in the coming years.\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter .

      "text": "Why Are Right-Wingers So Obsessed With Electromagnetic Pulses? Ahead of Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference next week, Bloomberg is reporting that the company will announce the end of its signature iTunes media platform. Apple will replace iTunes with three separate apps: Music, TV, and Podcasts. Debuting in 2001, iTunes had its heyday in the 2000s as a virtual jukebox in which people could store their 99-cent MP3 purchases from the online Music Store. Apple originally marketed the platform as a tool for burning custom mixes onto CDs, and then as a playlist organizer for the then newly released iPod. The platform eventually expanded to include podcasts and TV shows in 2005 and movies in 2006, and eventually hosted the Genius algorithm that could build playlists based on users\u2019 tastes. With the advent of streaming, tech analysts have been predicting the end of iTunes for at least three years . Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have forgone iTunes for stand-alone video, music, and podcast apps for quite some time now. The Apple Music streaming service has been the default for devices for a while. It\u2019s only Mac computers that still use the iTunes platform. As Rolling Stone suggests, phasing out iTunes fits in with Apple\u2019s overall strategy to become an entertainment services provider. Sales for its marquee iPhone lines have begun to lose steam in recent years, so Apple has been exploring new markets with TV, payment, newspaper, and gaming products. Users have also long had complaints about iTunes\u2019 clunky integration and syncing features. We\u2019re likely to get the full details of iTunes\u2019 retirement during the WWDC keynote speech on Monday.",

So, yay, but also boo.\nFinding out a cool new game has been released on the iTunes App Store, purchasing it, and then having the \u201cApp Over 150 MB\u201d message pop-up, urging you to connect to a Wi-Fi network before you can play is frustrating. As of this week, as reported by 9 to 5 Mac and confirmed by me trying to download Stardew Valley using cellular data, the message has changed, but the frustration stays the same.\nApple last upped the data cap from 100 MB to 150 MB back in 2017. That\u2019s after increasing it from 50 MB to 100 MB in 2013. If trends continue, in a couple more years we\u2019ll be able to download a quarter of a gigabyte, all at once. The future sounds awesome.\nI have unlimited cellular data. Lots of people do. I would really like it if there were an option to ignore the app overage message, either through settings or an additional option in the dialog box.\nBut hey, congrats to people downloading games that were between 151 and 200 MB. And to the developers who can now make their apps\u2019 initial downloads a little bit larger before the game is launched and a couple of gigs of additional data is downloaded over cellular networks anyway.",

No more cable catastrophes.\nBy STACK COMMERCE Mashable Deals 2019-05-31 15:01:06 UTC\nWireless charging has been around since the late 19th century (shoutout to Nikola Tesla!), but it\u2019s only until recently that the biggest tech companies hopped on the bandwagon and started integrating the technology into their products.\nNow, almost every phone and tablet are capable of charging without cords, essentially signaling an imminent wireless revolution.

Though it didn\u2019t mention a source, the website said the upcoming handset may feature the quad-camera setup, giving the device \u2026\nThe capacitive buttons rumor will probably be less contentious, although many users of HTC devices with capacitive keys ran into trouble with the design feature.\nThe Galaxy Note 10 will likely launch in August in multiple variants. It\u2019s possible there will be a regular version, a \u201cpro\u201d or larger version, and a 5G version \u2014 although the pro and 5G versions could be one and the same.\nWhat do you think? Would you stop buying Samsung phones if the company removes the headphone jack? Or have you accepted the fate of the jack\u2019s removal? Let us know in the comments.\nIn the meantime, read up on all the credible rumors surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 below: NEXT: Samsung Galaxy Note 10: All the rumors in one place",

      "text": " Qualcomm Price Target Cut During Worst Month in Years Evercore ISI slashed its QCOM price target by Karee Venema Published on May 31, 2019 at 9:50 AM Updated on May 31, 2019 at 11:13 AM QCOM is headed toward its biggest monthly loss since early 2002\nQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) topped out above $90 earlier this month after the chipmaker settled with Apple (AAPL) in a patent dispute -- marking QCOM stock's highest mark since January 2000. The shares quickly retreated on news of an antitrust court ruling , last seen down 1.6% at $65.56 -- putting them on track for their worst monthly performance since February 2002.\nThis may be what prompted Evercore ISI this morning to slash its QCOM price target to $90 from $105, though this still represents a 35% premium to last night's close. Most analysts are bullish on Qualcomm, with 12 of 19 maintaining a \"buy\" or better rating. Plus, the average 12-month price target is in line with Evercore's new target price.\nIn the options pits, put traders have been active in recent weeks. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), QCOM's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.68 ranks in the 92nd annual percentile, meaning puts have been bought to open relative to calls at a quicker-than-usual clip. However, put writers have been present, too. More specifically, the June 62.50 put has seen the biggest increase in open interest over this two-week time frame, and data from the major exchanges confirms notable sell-to-open activity here. By using this neutral-to-bullish options strategy , speculators expect QCOM to remain above the $62.50 level through June options expiration.",

      "text": "by janyobytes We used our iPhone to ride the New York City subway today \u2013 it\u2019s the future\nNew York City is hard. Fact. Here are two more NYC life facts: I'm never not carrying multiple things in my hand, and one thing I'm always juggling is my smartphone.\nThat's why I'm ready to say goodbye to fetching my yellow MetroCard every time I use the subway or bus, and say hello to New York's contactless payment system.\nI was so ready for the changeover that I 'camped out' at Grand Central Station, as if this were an old-fashioned Apple launch, to be the first to use the MTA's now publicly launched OMNY (One Metro New York) contactless payment system today.\nUsing an iPhone XR and Apple Watch 4 to get through the Grand Central turnstile, I found it to be as seamless as it is overdue for New Yorkers.\nHere are some facts we discovered on our first contactless NYC commute. It's incredibly easy to use\nIt was hard to take a photo of the OMNY contactless payment process in action for this article simply because it happens so fast. But that's the point of it, right?\nWe didn't need to unlock and open our iPhone, or authenticate with Face ID, to pay. Just holding the back of the phone up to the newly installed turnstile screen gave us the green light to start our underground journey.\nThe thing that grabs me the most about this process is that it doesn't require people to fetch their MetroCard when we all usually have a phone in hand. I see folks paw at their purses and slim jean pockets with their one free [non-phone] hand, looking for the thin card.\nOMNY represents less juggling for those of us who see each day go by in a New York minute. Bonus points: we don't need to wastefully print out plastic MetroCards anymore. But it was also unsurprisingly late\nI got to demo the MTA's OMNY (One Metro New York) system the exact minute it went live to the public. It was, of course, a little bit late.\nIts noon launch actually happened at 12:19pm ET, and it slowly spread to all of the Grand Central turnstiles. I dashed for the first one that lit up to test it out.\nLate or not, seeing OMNY work without a hitch once the system was online was impressive. MTA workers overseeing the project were visibly excited (I even got a cheer when I went through the turnstile \u2013 again, big time Apple product launch energy).\nLondon, Chicago and other cities already have contactless systems like this installed (and have for years), so New York is late that different, too. Like we said, the transition is long overdue for the biggest transit system in the US. Using an iPhone is great, using an Apple Watch is better\nPaying with an iPhone via Apple Pay worked great. We haven't tried using Android yet, but we will next trip, and we know it works with Google Pay in similar fashion.\nThe Apple Watch is even easier when you have things in your hand (Image credit: TechRadar)\nThat said, I could see myself using the Apple Watch more regularly when carrying other things in both my hands, or rolling a suitcase with my phone in my pocket.\nI did find I had to double tap the Watch side button to enter Apple Pay to get this to work \u2013 unlike the iPhone, which works without any prompt needed. Hopefully this changes down the line, maybe with watchOS 6 . New Yorkers are overeager to use\u2026 incorrectly\nThe entire week, I witnessed New Yorkers pressing their plastic yellow MetroCards up against the NFC reader screen\u2026 to absolutely no effect. They wanted it to work already.\nThey were even more confused when the screen went from saying 'Testing phase,' to saying 'MetroCard only' with a yellow background in the last 48 hours. To them that meant 'press your yellow MetroCard here.' It really meant, 'Keep swiping.'\nNow both of those pre-launch messages have vanished and MTA employees have been handing out OMNY explainer pamphlets to people. But now that things work, everyone seem to know what to do. Officially on 4-5-6 trains, secretly works elsewhere\nHere's something that wasn't announced, but we discovered today: it works on more subway lines than the MTA announced \u2013 if the 4-5-6 runs through the same station.\nThe dedicated 7 train entrance in Grand Central also works with OMNY (Image credit: TechRadar)\nOfficially, it works on the 4-5-6 subway between Grand Central and Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center and Staten Island buses. For our second test, we used it on the 7 train at Grand Central (even the dedicated 7 train entrance worked flawlessly for us).\nIn other words, even if you don't use the 4-5-6 subway, there's a chance you could still take advantage of using your iPhone or Android to pay for your subway ride on a nearby track. The OMNY rollout is a lot bigger than anyone first expected. But it's mostly for tourists and one-off riders today\nToday is the beginning of the end of the MetroCard, but local New Yorkers with daily commutes may not be using it often because discounts fares don't apply.\nIt's meant for one-off full fares: $2.75. Commuters won't be able to add time (weeks or months) in 2019, and multiple ride discount seekers won't find any small savings.\nLikewise, riders with disabilities will have to stay on the MetroCard, according to the MTA. Discounted rides via OMNY are a 2020 thing, alongside the system's more widespread rollout.\nImage credit: TechRadar You'll need iOS 12.3, but can't use iOS 12.4 beta\nI had to roll back to iOS 12.3.1 to add Express Transit to my default credit card within the Wallet app. The Express Transit settings menu option vanished in iOS 12.4 beta.\nThat should change at WWDC 2019 should Apple officially launch iOS 12.4. Hopefully it remains an option if developers upgrade to the iOS 13 beta next week, too. I ended up spending $16.50 to bring you this article\nOops. This article cost more than I anticipated simply because we have to tap our devices multiple times to get multiple photo, video and the full experience.\nThe OMNY reader does provide ample time for you to get through the turnstile, but it also does eventually time out (it seems like a minute and a half if you don't go through the turnstile). That's important information to mention, and my noting it means I can write this off\u2026 hopefully.\nfrom TechRadar \u2013 All the latest technology news http://www.techradar.com/news/nyc-subway-omny-review Share this:",

      "text": "Search \u2018Nyra\u2019 app launched to help women manage feminine health Nyra is the first product to be launched by Vivant under its Nyra women\u2019s health brand. Share\nScreengrab of the Nyra app.\nMumbai-India headquartered digital health start-up Vivant recently launched \u2018Nyra\u2019, a simple mobile application that can be used by women to track their period, fertility, ovulation, mood, lifestyle and physical activity.\nBased on the health information collected, the app provides women with personalised feminine health, hygiene and fertility advice to help manage their wellbeing. In addition to English, the app is also available in vernacular language starting with Hindi.\nNyra is the first product to be launched by Vivant under its Nyra women\u2019s health brand. Further products are expected covering a range of women\u2019s health and wellness issues including pregnancy, post-pregnancy care and re-entering the workplace.\nNyra is now available for download on Apple and Google app stores.\nWhat\u2019s the trend\nThere is an increasing interest in reproductive and feminine health by digital health/health tech companies. Last November, Ava, a medical technology company focused on innovations in women's reproductive health expanded into Asia with the launch of an office in Hong Kong . The company\u2019s popular fertility tracker is sold in 33 countries and the accompanying Ava app features a newsfeed-style health dashboard.\nLast month, fitness wearable tech company Garmin announced a new menstrual cycle tracking to its app-based online fitness service. Garmin Connect users can record their cycle type, symptoms and notes about their personal health. By doing so, the service will begin to predict when their next period will occur or outline windows of increased fertility. In addition, the app will surface fitness and nutrition educational content that is tailored to the user\u2019s current phase of their cycle.\nOn the record\n\u201cWe are seeing a major opportunity to tap into the potential of digital platforms to transform women\u2019s health in Asia and the Middle East. In many countries in these regions women\u2019s health remains a taboo subject and awareness and adoption of feminine health practices is staggeringly low. At the same time, digital penetration is high, and this is creating a significant opportunity for digital health applications to deliver real social benefits,\u201d said Adrit Raha, Chief Executive Officer, Vivant, in a statement.\n\u201cIn India, for example, it is estimated that around 23 million girls have dropped out of school due to menstruation and a lack of awareness of women\u2019s health issues. Nyra aims to help address this by giving women everywhere access to feminine health information and advice, and control over their feminine health journey. We have initially launched the app to include Hindi, but are actively looking to make the app available in other vernacular languages used across Asia and the Middle East to reach all underserved women in these regions,\u201d he added.

      "text": "Eli Apple on not having 2020 option picked up: Have to go out and prove myself Posted by Josh Alper on May 31, 2019, 5:29 PM EDT Getty Images\nThe Saints traded for cornerback Eli Apple last October and he played a starting role in the secondary as the team\u2019s defense improved over the second half of the season, but that wasn\u2019t enough for them to pick up their option on his contract for the 2020 season.\nApple would have been set to make $13.7 million next year had the option been exercised, but he said he\u2019s not letting that affect his approach to the 2019 season. Apple said he is in \u201ca great place and a great organization\u201d and is going to focus on playing as well as possible before his contract is up.\n\u201cNah, I try not think about it too much,\u201d Apple said, via the New Orleans Advocate . \u201cIt is what it is. I just have to go out and get it this year and prove myself and continue to prove what I can do on the field. Everything is going to take care of itself.\u201d\nIf Apple does perform at a high level, he probably won\u2019t be thinking too much about the option after the season either because he\u2019ll be set to cash in with the Saints or someone else.

      "text": "By Victoria Song on at\nBumpy car rides suck and a newly published patent reveals Apple has fairly recently been exploring a \u201cfully-actuated suspension system\u201d using variable pressure air springs and a haptic-feedback system to create a smoother ride.\nThe patent was originally filed in March 2016 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and originates from Apple\u2019s Project Titan division. It was finally published this week. The filing features a lot of technical gobbledygook, but in essence, it describes a suspension system that can \u201ccompensate for vehicle oscillations at frequencies below the primary ride frequency,\u201d which would in turn potentially reduce motion sickness. It also details improvements to its braking and suspension for a generally smoother ride.\nImage: US PTO\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but one of the more interesting parts of the patent is a section where Apple details a haptic feedback system. The filing notes that its particular actuation system could relay specific information to a driver that could improve situational awareness. For instance, because each of the car\u2019s wheels can be actuated, a driver might get haptic feedback about which direction to turn. The patent also provides an example where a car\u2019s sensors may be able to detect oncoming vehicles, or crossing pedestrians and deliver feedback to the driver.\nSo is Apple truly serious about developing tech for cars? Possibly, it\u2019s own self-driving car? Perhaps. Tech giants file patents all the time for innovations that may never see the light of day, and Apple is no exception. Earlier in January, Apple laid off more than 200 employees working on Project Titan\u2014its secretive self-driving car initiative. That layoff was reported to be part of a restructuring. Then, back in April, Apple was again reported to be hunting for a better self-driving car sensor .\nThe question at hand here isn\u2019t whether Apple is interested in cars . It\u2019s whether it\u2019s working to build a so-called \u201ciCar\u201d, or just looking to develop software. The layoffs seemed to hint at the latter, while the purported search for better sensors suggests the former. Meanwhile, recent reports that Apple is building large driving rooms for testing indicate that maybe the company hasn\u2019t truly given up on building its own car after all. At this point, however, it\u2019s all speculation. The only people who really know are probably laughing at the rest of us in a bunker somewhere in Cupertino. [ USPTO via Apple Insider ] Tags:",

      "text": "Graham Hartmann Apple The end of an era is upon us, as Apple will be discontinuing iTunes. The official announcement is expected to be made at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. Though streaming is king in 2019, it was iTunes which killed the CD. With the release of iTunes and the iPod, music lovers could not only carry a gigantic amount of music on a then-tiny device, but buy as many single songs as possible instead of an entire album. The revolution turned the record industry on its head, but also successfully combated illegal downloading from services like Napster. The \u201cEnd of iTunes\u201d was revealed by Bloomberg in an article previewing the Worldwide Developers Conference: iTunes has been the way Apple users listen to music, watch movies and TV shows, hear podcasts, and manage their devices for almost two decades. This year, Apple is finally ready to move into a new era. The company is launching a trio of new apps for the Mac \u2013 Music, TV, and Podcasts \u2013 to replace iTunes. That matches Apple\u2019s media app strategy on iPhones and iPads. Without iTunes, customers can manage their Apple gadgets through the Music app. Instead of customers using iTunes for all their entertainment needs, Apple will split Music, TV and Podcasts into three separate apps to be used on iPhones and iPads. So long iTunes and thanks for all the upgrade invites. Rockers We\u2019ve Lost in 2019",

      "title": "Xiaomi and Redmi are looking to dominate in 2019",
      "text": "Contact Xiaomi and Redmi are looking to dominate in 2019\nIn an interview with Sina Tech published earlier today, Redmi general Lu Weibing wasn\u2019t shy about how Xiaomi and Redmi plan to aggressively expand its operations in 2019.\nAccording to Weibing, Redmi plans to increase its investment in Europe and India. Currently, the top four smartphone manufacturers in Europe are Samsung , Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi. In India, the top four smartphone companies are Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, and Oppo.\nInterestingly, Weibing claimed that Xiaomi could obtain 50 percent of the smartphone market in India. That would be a considerable leap from the 29-percent market share that Xiaomi currently holds in India , but not completely impossible. In March, Xiaomi reported that it sold 200,000 Redmi Note 7 units in a matter of minutes . Editor\u2019s Pick These are the best Xiaomi phones Xiaomi has a lot of fantastic phones, and they all offer great value. The company does most of its business in China and India, but it\u2019s slowly expanding to Western markets as well. You can \u2026\nWeibing also said that Redmi will focus on Latin American and African markets throughout the year, with plans to enter east, west, and central African markets this year. As it does in other areas, Redmi will be online-only in African markets and use a similar e-commerce strategy. That means plenty of flash sales for Africa residents.\nUnfortunately, Weibing doesn\u2019t mention any expansion into the United States. Xiaomi has talked about entering the U.S. market , but the country\u2019s ongoing trade war with China and issues with Huawei might have the company thinking twice about such a move.\nAndroid Authority reached out to Xiaomi for comment on Weibing\u2019s interview, but didn\u2019t receive a response by press time.",

      "text": "This week in Apple: The top news from Android\u2019s main competitor Rumor-based renders of the iPhone 11 (or iPhone XI, maybe).\nMacRumors Welcome to a new series on Android Authority which gives a rundown of the latest news related to Android\u2019s primary competitor, Apple. This is an easy way for Android fans to stay up-to-date on what\u2019s happening in mobile outside the Android world.\nThis week in Apple news there\u2019s the possibility of it retiring one of its most iconic products. We also saw the company embroiled in a new privacy lawsuit as well as having to deal with Google\u2019s insinuation that Apple dishes privacy as \u201ca luxury good.\u201d We also heard some interesting rumors surrounding the 2019 iPhones, the 2020 iPhones, and what could get announced at WWDC 2019 (which starts on Monday). Oh yeah, and there\u2019s a new iPod Touch . For real.\nSee the roundup below for all the latest! The top Apple news stories of the past week: Surprise! New iPod Touch is for sale: Apple dropped a surprising upgrade to the iPod Touch. It now comes with an A10 fusion chip and a new 256GB storage option. An entry-level Touch will set you back $200 , while a maxed-out model will cost $400 . And yes, it still has a headphone jack. No more iTunes?: According to a new rumor , Apple could do away with iTunes in the next version of macOS, expected to debut on Monday. We previously heard the company was going to break up iTunes into other apps, but now it seems that break up could mean the end of the iTunes branding. 2019 iPhones could finally get dual-Bluetooth support: We Android users have enjoyed this for quite a while now, but it looks likely that iOS users could finally have the ability to use two Bluetooth devices at the same time on one iPhone. This would enable two people to connect to one phone and listen to music simultaneously. 2019 iPhones might not have 3D Touch: There\u2019s a rumor that the pressure-sensitive touch feature on iPhones \u2014 sold as 3D Touch \u2014 could be going away . Instead, Haptic Touch could take its place in the upcoming crop of 2019 iPhones. This feature already exists on the iPhone XR . System-wide dark mode could come with iOS 13: We expect Apple to drop iOS 13 at WWDC on Monday. Although nothing is known for certain yet, it\u2019s looking very likely that Apple will introduce a system-wide dark mode for iOS at that event. Looks like Apple will beat Android to the punch on that one. 2020 iPhones could have in-display fingerprint sensor under entire screen: According to analysts speaking with the Apple supply chain, the 2020 iPhones will have \u201cacoustic fingerprint technology\u201d which will allow for full-screen Touch ID. Android\u2019s already beaten Apple to the punch with in-display sensors, but if Apple could make it work on the entire screen, that would be pretty cool. Apple is having privacy problems: A new lawsuit filed against Apple alleges that the company is tracking and selling iTunes data, despite Tim Cook\u2019s claims to the contrary. And in related news, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai threw some shade at Apple for making privacy into a \u201cluxury good.\u201d Apple\u2019s software engineering chief Craig Federighi disputed that assumption . Apple starts new webpage to counter monopoly claims: With numerous complaints from developers as well as a lawsuit (which received the Supreme Court\u2019s blessing ) that call out the Apple App Store as a monopoly, the company has responded by making a new website explaining how it isn\u2019t that. It points to apps for sale that compete against its own apps as an example. Thinking about making the switch?\nIf you are currently an Apple user thinking about making the switch to Android, we have multiple articles and guides that can help you with that process. Despite how it might seem, moving from iOS to Android is easier than ever, and many of the services and systems on iOS have similar or even the same counterparts on Android.

      "text": "Xiaomi and Redmi are looking to dominate in 2019 Xiaomi and Redmi are looking to dominate in 2019 31 May Mobile , Smartphone\nIn an interview with Sina Tech published earlier today, Redmi general Lu Weibing wasn\u2019t shy about how Xiaomi and Redmi plan to aggressively expand its operations in 2019.\nAccording to Weibing, Redmi plans to increase its investment in Europe and India. Currently, the top four smartphone manufacturers in Europe are Samsung , Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi. In India, the top four smartphone companies are Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, and Oppo.\nInterestingly, Weibing claimed that Xiaomi could obtain 50 percent of the smartphone market in India. That would be a considerable leap from the 29-percent market share that Xiaomi currently holds in India , but not completely impossible. In March, Xiaomi reported that it sold 200,000 Redmi Note 7 units in a matter of minutes . Editor's Pick These are the best Xiaomi phones Xiaomi has a lot of fantastic phones, and they all offer great value. The company does most of its business in China and India, but it's slowly expanding to Western markets as well. You can \u2026\nWeibing also said that Redmi will focus on Latin American and African markets throughout the year, with plans to enter east, west, and central African markets this year. As it does in other areas, Redmi will be online-only in African markets and use a similar e-commerce strategy. That means plenty of flash sales for Africa residents.\nUnfortunately, Weibing doesn\u2019t mention any expansion into the United States. Xiaomi has talked about entering the U.S. market , but the country\u2019s ongoing trade war with China and issues with Huawei might have the company thinking twice about such a move.\nAndroid Authority reached out to Xiaomi for comment on Weibing\u2019s interview, but didn\u2019t receive a response by press time.",

      "text": "Expect a fond farewell from iTunes at WWDC Expect a fond farewell from iTunes at WWDC\nApple\nAccording to Bloomberg , iTunes will be retired at WWDC 2019. The consolidated application will be broken up into three Mac apps: Music, TV, and Podcasts. While this is new for desktop owners, its something iPhone and iPad users acclimated to with the 2015 release of Apple Music . Editor's Pick YouTube Music, YouTube Premium bring ad free music and video streaming to India Music listeners in India have never had it better. Hot on the heels of the launch of Spotify, Google is introducing YouTube Music and YouTube Premium in India. The two services are distinctly unique offerings \u2026\nThe delegation of tasks to three new applications may seem a cumbersome step forward, but it will likely resolve the main complaint of iTunes users: bloated software. Hopefully the new division of labor will yield quick and efficient runtimes from each application. We anticipate that Music will manage iOS devices in lieu of iTunes and anticipate an official statement from WWDC.\nApple\u2019s pivotal media app was first announced by Steve Jobs in 2011 as a jukebox application with a simple user interface. It ushered in the era of digital and mobile media by making it accessible to all consumers, regardless of technical experience. If not for iTunes, the smorgasbord of streaming services at our disposal may not exist, or at least not how we recognize them.\nWWDC 2019 begins Monday at 10 a.m. PST, and Android Authority will keep you informed regarding the event.

      "title": "This week in Apple: The top news from Android\u2019s main competitor",
      "text": "MacRumors Welcome to a new series on Android Authority which gives a rundown of the latest news related to Android\u2019s primary competitor, Apple. This is an easy way for Android fans to stay up-to-date on what\u2019s happening in mobile outside the Android world.\nThis week in Apple news there\u2019s the possibility of it retiring one of its most iconic products. We also saw the company embroiled in a new privacy lawsuit as well as having to deal with Google\u2019s insinuation that Apple dishes privacy as \u201ca luxury good.\u201d We also heard some interesting rumors surrounding the 2019 iPhones, the 2020 iPhones, and what could get announced at WWDC 2019 (which starts on Monday). Oh yeah, and there\u2019s a new iPod Touch . For real.\nSee the roundup below for all the latest! The top Apple news stories of the past week: Surprise! New iPod Touch is for sale: Apple dropped a surprising upgrade to the iPod Touch. It now comes with an A10 fusion chip and a new 256GB storage option. An entry-level Touch will set you back $200 , while a maxed-out model will cost $400 . And yes, it still has a headphone jack. No more iTunes?: According to a new rumor , Apple could do away with iTunes in the next version of macOS, expected to debut on Monday. We previously heard the company was going to break up iTunes into other apps, but now it seems that break up could mean the end of the iTunes branding. 2019 iPhones could finally get dual-Bluetooth support: We Android users have enjoyed this for quite a while now, but it looks likely that iOS users could finally have the ability to use two Bluetooth devices at the same time on one iPhone. This would enable two people to connect to one phone and listen to music simultaneously. 2019 iPhones might not have 3D Touch: There\u2019s a rumor that the pressure-sensitive touch feature on iPhones \u2014 sold as 3D Touch \u2014 could be going away . Instead, Haptic Touch could take its place in the upcoming crop of 2019 iPhones. This feature already exists on the iPhone XR . System-wide dark mode could come with iOS 13: We expect Apple to drop iOS 13 at WWDC on Monday. Although nothing is known for certain yet, it\u2019s looking very likely that Apple will introduce a system-wide dark mode for iOS at that event. Looks like Apple will beat Android to the punch on that one. 2020 iPhones could have in-display fingerprint sensor under entire screen: According to analysts speaking with the Apple supply chain, the 2020 iPhones will have \u201cacoustic fingerprint technology\u201d which will allow for full-screen Touch ID. Android\u2019s already beaten Apple to the punch with in-display sensors, but if Apple could make it work on the entire screen, that would be pretty cool. Apple is having privacy problems: A new lawsuit filed against Apple alleges that the company is tracking and selling iTunes data, despite Tim Cook\u2019s claims to the contrary. And in related news, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai threw some shade at Apple for making privacy into a \u201cluxury good.\u201d Apple\u2019s software engineering chief Craig Federighi disputed that assumption . Apple starts new webpage to counter monopoly claims: With numerous complaints from developers as well as a lawsuit (which received the Supreme Court\u2019s blessing ) that call out the Apple App Store as a monopoly, the company has responded by making a new website explaining how it isn\u2019t that. It points to apps for sale that compete against its own apps as an example. Thinking about making the switch?\nIf you are currently an Apple user thinking about making the switch to Android, we have multiple articles and guides that can help you with that process.

      "text": "on Friday May 31, 2019 @04:50PM from the shape-of-things-to-come dept. It's pretty much a given that next week's Apple Worldwide Developer Conference will bring new versions of MacOS and iOS. The real question is just how much convergence there will be between the 2 operating systems . From a report: The Mac remains popular even as the bulk of Apple's business is now selling phones and tablets, both of which have been increasing in computing power. Apple has long said it doesn't plan to merge its mobile and computer operating systems , but the two have been moving closer together recently. Apple offered a \"sneak peek\" last year at its multiyear effort (known internally as Marzipan) to allow programs written for iOS devices like the iPad to run on Macs with minimal changes. Last year, the company said it was testing the technology first with its own apps, like Stocks and Voice Memos, and would offer other developers a chance to adapt their apps over time. Developers are champing at the bit for their taste of Marzipan, and WWDC could offer them a way in. Apple is likely to preview upgrades to its TV and watch operating systems and perhaps give a few more details on some of its new services, such as Arcade, a subscription iOS game service due out this fall. \u2190",

      "title": "Motorola says no Z4 Force this year as flagship ambitions wither",
      "text": "Motorola hasn\u2019t been competing in the flagship Android arena for a couple of years now, not since the Moto Z2 days. Instead, the company has put its focus on its Moto Mods initiative and the midrange and budget models in its Moto Z and Moto G lines .\nBut some fans may have been holding out hope for a revival of the Force line, the high-end variant of the Moto Z that hasn\u2019t seen a proper release since 2017. Unfortunately, Motorola is outright squashing hopes for a Moto Z4 Force, after the Z4 was officially unveiled earlier this week .\n\u201cWe will not be announcing additional Moto Z devices this year,\u201d writes Motorola US on Twitter this afternoon , in response to a user\u2019s request to be informed when a Z4 Force would be made available. It\u2019s not too surprising; we didn\u2019t get a Z3 Force last year , and the Z4 is just an incrementally updated version of that midrange phone.\nHi Raffi. We will not be announcing additional moto z devices this year.\n\u2014 Motorola US (@MotorolaUS) May 30, 2019 Given the current state of the high-end phone market, where Apple is struggling to sell iPhones due to saturation and four-digit price tags, it\u2019s not surprising to see more Android phone makers put their focus in the midrange and prioritize features like battery life over newer components and higher-end materials. Google recently introduced the Pixel 3A , priced starting at $399, precisely because it saw lower-than-expected sales of its flagship Pixel 3 .\nBy all accounts, the Moto Z4 has everything you\u2019d want out of a $499 phone: strong battery life, a decent processor, and the ability to work with Verizon\u2019s 5G network thanks to the companion 5G Moto Mod. The standout selling point of the Force line was its shatterproof screen, but it looks like that\u2019s not a good enough reason to want to make a pricier variant when it has to go head-to-head with newer Galaxy, iPhone, LG, and Pixel devices.",

      "title": "Synchrony Financial CEO Taking Wait And See Approach With Apple Card",
      "text": "Print\nMargaret Keane, the CEO of Synchrony Financial, the biggest provider of store credit cards, said the card industry will be keeping a close watch on how Goldman Sachs handles its partnership with Apple in regards to the newly announced Apple Card.\nBloomberg reported Keane was at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York on Friday (May 31) when she made her comments.\nShe said that \u201cthere were a lot of us\u201d trying to be Apple\u2019s partner, and that \u201cwe\u2019re all going to watch and see what happens.\u201d\nThe card will give users cash back, with 2 percent back on every purchase made with the card, and 3 percent on Apple Store or App Store purchases. The two companies will also have a program that encourages users to pay down debt in weekly and biweekly payments.\n\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s a startup \u2014 they\u2019re starting from scratch,\u201d Keane said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing startups, by the way, there are a lot of upfront costs you have to put up just from pure marketing and set-up perspectives. So you have to make sure you\u2019re doing these deals at the right returns. So we\u2019re not going to win every deal, nor would you want us winning every deal.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs said that because it doesn\u2019t have the same legacy costs as many of its competitors, its consumer lending initiative is at an advantage. The bank said its \u201cthrilled to partner with Apple\u201d and that it wants \u201cto disrupt consumer finance by putting the customer first.\u201d\nPYMNTS CEO Karen Webster shared her own thoughts on the card in a piece written in April .\n\u201cThen there\u2019s the Apple Card, now one of literally hundreds of co-branded credit cards in the market. Co-branded cards, as all payments professionals know, have been around for decades. The first one, the American Airlines card, debuted in 1981,\u201d Webster wrote. \u201cCash back as a reward isn\u2019t exactly new, either \u2014 and Apple\u2019s version, which pays 1 percent cash back on everyday purchases, seems particularly ho-hum. Discover was the first to make a splash with its cash back bonus back in 2006.\u201d\nWebster also posited that the card highlights something that could be missing in Apple\u2019s payment goals.\n\u201cMore to the point, introducing a physical card seems a tacit admission that Apple Pay and contactless mobile payments aren\u2019t moving the needle enough on Apple\u2019s payments ambitions. The launch of the lowly physical card was needed to give it some transaction mojo,\u201d Webster said. \u201cNow, nearly half a decade after the launch of the mobile payments wallet that Apple\u2019s CEO told the world would eliminate the need for consumers to use a plastic card, Apple is embracing it with the hope that consumers will give Apple and payments another look.\u201d\n\u2013",

      "text": "Permalink\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference is slated to kick-off on Monday, and it\u2019s shaping up to be one of the busiest years yet. At WWDC 2019, Apple will unveil iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13, and watchOS 6. There\u2019s also the possibility of new hardware and more. Read on as we roundup everything to expect at WWDC 2019. Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip Software\nAs is always the case, expect the main focus of WWDC this year to be on software. WWDC is Apple\u2019s opportunity to give developers a first-hand look at its new operating systems, giving them ample time to update their own apps ahead of public releases in the fall.\nApple will likely offer developer betas of watchOS 6, iOS 13, tvOS 13, and macOS 10.15 on June 3rd, the same day as its opening WWDC keynote. Public betas of each release will be available later in the summer, save for watchOS, which Apple does not offer to public beta testers.\nWhat can you expect from each of these updates at WWDC? Read on to find out.\niOS 13\niOS 13 is expected to include a wide array of new features. The most popular new feature for many people will be the long-awaited addition of a system-wide Dark Mode, which 9to5Mac exclusively offered the first look of this week .\nIn addition to Dark Mode, iOS 13 is expected to include a new \u201cFind My\u201d app that merges Find My Friends and Find My iPhone into a unified interface. This app will also include a \u201cFind Network\u201d feature that allows devices to be tracked even if they aren\u2019t connected to WiFi or cellular.\nThe iPad is expected to get a nice update with iOS 13 at WWDC. The update will add support for multiple windows of applications using a new \u201cdetachable panel\u201d style interface. Each window will be able to contain sheets that are attached to a portion of the screen but can be detached and moved around freely.\nAdditional rumored iPad enhancements include a revamped Home screen design and support for mouse input as an accessibility feature.\nOther new features in iOS 13 include a \u201cSleep Mode,\u201d updates to apps such as Reminders, Health, Home, and Books, Screen Time enhancements, a refreshed volume HUD, and more.\nRead our full roundup of iOS 13 features here .\nmacOS 10.15\nmacOS 10.15 is expected to focus heavily on Marzipan, Apple\u2019s technology for easily porting iPad apps to the Mac. Apple offered its first look at the technology last year, using it bring apps like News and Home to the Mac. Now, developers will also soon be able to use the technology to bring their own iPad apps to the Mac.\nThis year\u2019s macOS update will include a brand new Music app , which will be based on iTunes code but feature an all-new design with a focus on Apple Music. Podcasts will be spun out of iTunes, with Apple launching a dedicated Podcasts app for the Mac with Marzipan.\nApple is also developing a new external display functionality that will allow users to send any window of any app to an external display. Users can send the app to an actual external display or even to an iPad.\nmacOS 10.15 will also include Screen Time, Shortcuts, expanded Apple Watch authentication, Apple\u2019s new \u201cFind My\u201d app, and more.\nRead our full roundup of macOS 10.15 features here .\nwatchOS 6\nFor Apple Watch users, watchOS 6 will include several notable enhancements. The update will reportedly include a host of new watch faces and complications, including new faces called \u201cCalifornia,\u201d\u201cGradient,\u201d\u201cX-Large,\u201d and more. New complications reportedly include ones for audiobooks, battery life, hearing aids, external noise measure, and rain data.\nAlso with watchOS 6, the Apple Watch will gain its own on-device App Store. Currently, the watchOS App Store is buried within the Apple Watch companion app on iOS, but watchOS 6 will finally bring a dedicated App Store to the device.\nOther new features in watchOS include a new Books app for audiobooks, as well as a new \u201cCycles\u201d health app for tracking menstrual cycles and \u201cDose\u201d for managing pill dosage and reminders. The Voice Memos app from iPhone will also reportedly come to watchOS this year as will a Calculator app.\nRead our full roundup of watchOS 6 features here .\ntvOS 13\nWhile we know quite a bit about watchOS, macOS, and iOS, it\u2019s unclear what enhancements tvOS 13 might bring. One possibility is that the update will include support for multiple user accounts. Apple TV+ will launch later this year, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see more tvOS enhancements at that time. Hardware\nWhile WWDC is generally software-focused, there is always the possibility of new hardware especially in 2019. Apple is said to have a trio of high-end Mac products in the works, including a new Mac Pro, a new external display, and a 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nMac Pro\nA Bloomberg report earlier this month said that Apple is \u201cconsidering\u201d debuting its new Mac Pro at WWDC this year. Not much is known about the new machine, with Apple saying that it will be \u201cmodular\u201d to allow for easy expansion and upgrade.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple debuted a new Mac Pro at WWDC. In 2013, Apple offered a preview of the trash can-style Mac Pro at WWDC, releasing it later that year. It\u2019s possible that Apple could do something similar this year, offering a brief teaser for the Mac Pro and promising a release by the end of this year.\nExternal Display\nIn conjunction with the new Mac Pro, Apple is also developing a new standalone display. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that Apple is developing a 31.6-inch display with a 6K resolution. The display will feature miniLED technology as well as Night Shift, True Tone, HDR, and more.\nAs far as a release, Kuo has said that Apple is targeting a Q2 or Q3 release for the display. That aligns well with WWDC, so it certainly seems promising that Apple will unveil the display at WWDC this year. The new external display comes after Apple left the standalone display market in 2016 , discontinuing its Thunderbolt Display and pointing users towards third-party options.\nRead our full roundup of Apple display details here .\n16-inch MacBook Pro\nKuo has also reported that Apple is working on a new 16-inch MacBook Pro. This Mac is said to feature an \u201call-new design\u201d, and would also mark a new form factor altogether for the MacBook. Apple used to sell a 17-inch MacBook Pro, but for the last several years, the largest option has been the 15-inch model.\nA WWDC unveil for the 16-inch MacBook Pro is iffy \u2013 Apple just overhauled its MacBook Pro lineup with new processors this month. It\u2019s possible that the company simply didn\u2019t want that announcement to get buried at WWDC, but refreshing the MacBook Pro lineup in May and announcing an all-new machine in June would be abnormal for Apple. WWDC 2019 wrap-up\nThis year\u2019s WWDC is shaping up to be a busy one. Apple will announce the latest versions of iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. The event could also include a trio of long-awaited hardware announcements, including a new Mac Pro, display, and MacBook Pro.\nApple\u2019s WWDC 2019 keynote is slated to kick off at 10AM PT/1PM ET. 9to5Mac will have complete coverage of the event and everything you need to know. What are you most excited to see? Let us know down in the comments.",

      "text": "Archiv\nEarlier this week the iPod touch received a modest upgrade, arriving with little fanfare via an Apple press release . The new 7th-generation iPod touch has little in the way of new features, but it does receive a CPU spec-bump that takes it from an iPhone 6-era Apple A8 to an iPhone 7-era A10 Fusion chip, not to mention double the RAM of the previous generation.\nThe new hardware upgrades make it so that iPod touch users can enjoy Augmented Reality (AR) apps along with Group FaceTime capability for the first time. There\u2019s also a new 256 GB flash storage tier, another first for the iPod lineup. It means that in 2019, there\u2019s finally an iPod that bests the 160GB iPod Classic in terms of storage space.\nWhile the iPod touch isn\u2019t the mass market item that earlier members of the product line once were, Apple believes that there continues to be a viable audience for such a device. Not only is it ideal for storing large music libraries locally, but with the upcoming launch of the new Apple Arcade subscription gaming service , Apple continues to position the iPod touch as a handheld gaming option.\nAll of that said, should you consider buying this new iPod touch? Watch our hands-on video review for the details. Synology RT2600ac: The AirPort Extreme replacement. Unboxing\nIt\u2019s been quite a few years since I\u2019ve gone hands-on with an iPod touch, so I was looking forward to unboxing the new 7th-generation model. Just like previous iterations of the iPod touch, this latest version ships inside a clear plastic container with a Springboard sticker covering the display that\u2019s been modernized to represent iOS 12.\nInside the container, you\u2019ll find the iPod touch, documentation and Apple stickers, wired headphones with 3.5mm headphone jack, and Lightning to USB cable. Just like previous versions, you\u2019ll need to supply your own power brick in order to charge the device. iPod touch (2019) video review\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Initial impressions\nIf you\u2019ve been using modern X-era iPhones, then the iPod touch is going to seem somewhat antique both in appearance and functionality. Visually, it looks exactly the same as the 6th-generation model.\nFor starters, the iPod touch is tiny and sports an iPhone SE-like 4-inch display. If you\u2019ve been using an iPhone from the last couple of years, the iPod touch display is going to seem tiny. It also lacks the contrast ratio and wide color support found on modern iPhone hardware.\nThe small display isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, though, as it makes the device more portable and easier to hold in the hand. That\u2019s a particularly nice feature for younger children with smaller hands. Just keep in mind that displaying content on the iPod touch isn\u2019t nearly as immersive as it is on today\u2019s 5.8-6.5-inch iPhones. iPod touch 7th-generation Home button\nLike every other iPod touch before it, the seventh-gen model sports a physical, tactile Home button. After exclusively using an iPhone XS, along with the latest iPad Pro for the last few months, having a physical Home button feels like going back in time.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the iPod touch had Touch ID support built in, but the device is devoid of any sort of biometric authentication, which forces you to rely on passcodes for security. Of all of the things that the iPod touch omits, I miss Touch ID the most. I understand not having Face ID, but Touch ID would have made the experience so much nicer. iPod touch 7th-generation performance\nBut at least there is a healthy amount of speed thanks to the A10 Fusion chip in the iPod touch, a marked upgrade over the old A8 CPU released in 2015\u2019s model. Whereas the A8 feels downright pedestrian in this day and age, the A10, despite being a few years old itself, still has quite a bit of pep left in its step.\nBenchmark scores aren\u2019t anything to write home about, but the hardware is reasonably fast and provides enough power for most modern games and applications.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus A10 Fusion Geekbench scores\nCompared to the iPhone 7, Apple appears to have restrained the performance of the A10 Fusion in the iPod touch, most likely to assist with battery life. This makes the performance differences between the iPod touch and the A9-powered iPhone SE a little closer than initially expected.\niPhone SE A9 (left) vs iPod touch A10 Fusion\nThe new iPod touch also has 2GB of RAM for the very first time in the product line\u2019s history. Outside of the updated CPU, Apple doubling the amount of memory from 1GB to 2GB is the device\u2019s most compelling new feature. A lack of memory has historically been the iPod touch\u2019s Achilles heel and the 2019 model addresses this problem. iPod touch 7th-generation camera\nIn an effort to keep costs low, Apple resisted the temptation to grace the new iPod touch with new cameras. That means that it\u2019s sporting the same underpowered imaging hardware of its predecessor.\nImage captured with iPod touch\nNeither the 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera, nor the f/2.4 8MP rear-facing camera impresses at this juncture, but it\u2019s enough to get by for Group FaceTime, AR support, and basic image and video capture.\nAs it stands, the iPod touch 7 lags behind devices like the iPhone SE in terms of rear camera quality. Not only is the iPhone SE\u2019s camera more pixel dense, but it features a faster aperture and includes the ability to shoot 4K videos. iPod touch 7th-generation Group FaceTime and AR support\nWhereas the 6th-generation iPod touch lacked support for Group FaceTime and AR apps, the new 2019 iPod touch supports both features. In fact, these are two of the primary marketing points that Apple uses on its revised iPod touch product page.\nGroup FaceTime is a feature that launched during iOS 12\u2019s tenure, allowing more than 30 participants to join a FaceTime call simultaneously. The previous iPod touch supported Group FaceTime audio, but now iPod touch users can enjoy the video side of Group FaceTime conversations.\nAugmented Reality, which launched the year before, affords computer-generated perceptual information within a real-world environment. There\u2019s already a large variety of AR-supported apps available on the App Store \u2014many of them with an educational spin \u2014 but the 4-inch display is so small that I find AR to be less appealing on the iPod touch than it is on other devices. An ideal Apple Arcade companion?\nThe iPod touch has long been positioned as a handheld gaming device, but it\u2019s only now \u2014 with the upcoming launch of the Apple Arcade subscription service \u2014 that I feel that Apple is taking iOS gaming seriously.\nApple Arcade, which is scheduled to land later this fall, will include over 100 new games, and allow users to play offline or online, and jump between iOS devices, the Mac, and the Apple TV.\nWith the service\u2019s offline aspect, the iPod touch seems poised to be a solid portable handheld Apple Arcade companion. Users would be able to have access to a large swath of the Apple Arcade library at any time via the iPod touch. If Apple Arcade lives up to its potential, it could help push the hardware to an even wider audience. 9to5Mac\u2019s take\nThe iPod touch doesn\u2019t come close to iPhone or even iPad numbers, but it must sell enough to justify Apple doing a refresh. From what I understand, a lot of that demand comes from the enterprise retail and warehouse sector (for POS and inventory purposes).\nThe iPhone XS Max absolutely dwarfs the iPod touch\nThe iPod touch, the cheapest and smallest iOS device that Apple sells, will no doubt appeal to parents with small children as well. Its versatility and performance as an inexpensive gaming and education platform, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\nThat said, I feel that those in search of a small, all-purpose iOS device should seriously consider a refurbished iPhone SE over the iPod touch 7. Not only does the SE function as a phone with cellular connectivity, but it has a much better camera, and supports Touch ID. Performance wise, the iPod touch with its Apple A10 Fusion chip is obviously more potent than the A9 chip in the iPhone SE, but Apple appears to have held back the CPU in the iPod touch, perhaps with preserving battery life in mind.\nWould you consider buying an iPod touch in 2019? If so, for what purpose? Sound off down below in the comments with your thoughts.",

      "text": "Permalink\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference is slated to kick-off on Monday, and it\u2019s shaping up to be one of the busiest years yet. At WWDC 2019, Apple will unveil iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13, and watchOS 6. There\u2019s also the possibility of new hardware and more. Read on as we roundup everything to expect at WWDC 2019. Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip Software\nAs is always the case, expect the main focus of WWDC this year to be on software. WWDC is Apple\u2019s opportunity to give developers a first-hand look at its new operating systems, giving them ample time to update their own apps ahead of public releases in the fall.\nApple will likely offer developer betas of watchOS 6, iOS 13, tvOS 13, and macOS 10.15 on June 3rd, the same day as its opening WWDC keynote. Public betas of each release will be available later in the summer, save for watchOS, which Apple does not offer to public beta testers.\nWhat can you expect from each of these updates at WWDC? Read on to find out.\niOS 13\niOS 13 is expected to include a wide array of new features. The most popular new feature for many people will be the long-awaited addition of a system-wide Dark Mode, which 9to5Mac exclusively offered the first look of this week .\nIn addition to Dark Mode, iOS 13 is expected to include a new \u201cFind My\u201d app that merges Find My Friends and Find My iPhone into a unified interface. This app will also include a \u201cFind Network\u201d feature that allows devices to be tracked even if they aren\u2019t connected to WiFi or cellular.\nThe iPad is expected to get a nice update with iOS 13 at WWDC. The update will add support for multiple windows of applications using a new \u201cdetachable panel\u201d style interface. Each window will be able to contain sheets that are attached to a portion of the screen but can be detached and moved around freely.\nAdditional rumored iPad enhancements include a revamped Home screen design and support for mouse input as an accessibility feature.\nOther new features in iOS 13 include a \u201cSleep Mode,\u201d updates to apps such as Reminders, Health, Home, and Books, Screen Time enhancements, a refreshed volume HUD, and more.\nRead our full roundup of iOS 13 features here .\nmacOS 10.15\nmacOS 10.15 is expected to focus heavily on Marzipan, Apple\u2019s technology for easily porting iPad apps to the Mac. Apple offered its first look at the technology last year, using it bring apps like News and Home to the Mac. Now, developers will also soon be able to use the technology to bring their own iPad apps to the Mac.\nThis year\u2019s macOS update will include a brand new Music app , which will be based on iTunes code but feature an all-new design with a focus on Apple Music. Podcasts will be spun out of iTunes, with Apple launching a dedicated Podcasts app for the Mac with Marzipan.\nApple is also developing a new external display functionality that will allow users to send any window of any app to an external display. Users can send the app to an actual external display or even to an iPad.\nmacOS 10.15 will also include Screen Time, Shortcuts, expanded Apple Watch authentication, Apple\u2019s new \u201cFind My\u201d app, and more.\nRead our full roundup of macOS 10.15 features here .\nwatchOS 6\nFor Apple Watch users, watchOS 6 will include several notable enhancements. The update will reportedly include a host of new watch faces and complications, including new faces called \u201cCalifornia,\u201d\u201cGradient,\u201d\u201cX-Large,\u201d and more. New complications reportedly include ones for audiobooks, battery life, hearing aids, external noise measure, and rain data.\nAlso with watchOS 6, the Apple Watch will gain its own on-device App Store. Currently, the watchOS App Store is buried within the Apple Watch companion app on iOS, but watchOS 6 will finally bring a dedicated App Store to the device.\nOther new features in watchOS include a new Books app for audiobooks, as well as a new \u201cCycles\u201d health app for tracking menstrual cycles and \u201cDose\u201d for managing pill dosage and reminders. The Voice Memos app from iPhone will also reportedly come to watchOS this year as will a Calculator app.\nRead our full roundup of watchOS 6 features here .\ntvOS 13\nWhile we know quite a bit about watchOS, macOS, and iOS, it\u2019s unclear what enhancements tvOS 13 might bring. One possibility is that the update will include support for multiple user accounts. Apple TV+ will launch later this year, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see more tvOS enhancements at that time. Hardware\nWhile WWDC is generally software-focused, there is always the possibility of new hardware especially in 2019. Apple is said to have a trio of high-end Mac products in the works, including a new Mac Pro, a new external display, and a 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nMac Pro\nA Bloomberg report earlier this month said that Apple is \u201cconsidering\u201d debuting its new Mac Pro at WWDC this year. Not much is known about the new machine, with Apple saying that it will be \u201cmodular\u201d to allow for easy expansion and upgrade.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple debuted a new Mac Pro at WWDC. In 2013, Apple offered a preview of the trash can-style Mac Pro at WWDC, releasing it later that year. It\u2019s possible that Apple could do something similar this year, offering a brief teaser for the Mac Pro and promising a release by the end of this year.\nExternal Display\nIn conjunction with the new Mac Pro, Apple is also developing a new standalone display. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that Apple is developing a 31.6-inch display with a 6K resolution. The display will feature miniLED technology as well as Night Shift, True Tone, HDR, and more.\nAs far as a release, Kuo has said that Apple is targeting a Q2 or Q3 release for the display. That aligns well with WWDC, so it certainly seems promising that Apple will unveil the display at WWDC this year. The new external display comes after Apple left the standalone display market in 2016 , discontinuing its Thunderbolt Display and pointing users towards third-party options.\nRead our full roundup of Apple display details here .\n16-inch MacBook Pro\nKuo has also reported that Apple is working on a new 16-inch MacBook Pro. This Mac is said to feature an \u201call-new design\u201d, and would also mark a new form factor altogether for the MacBook. Apple used to sell a 17-inch MacBook Pro, but for the last several years, the largest option has been the 15-inch model.\nA WWDC unveil for the 16-inch MacBook Pro is iffy \u2013 Apple just overhauled its MacBook Pro lineup with new processors this month. It\u2019s possible that the company simply didn\u2019t want that announcement to get buried at WWDC, but refreshing the MacBook Pro lineup in May and announcing an all-new machine in June would be abnormal for Apple. WWDC 2019 wrap-up\nThis year\u2019s WWDC is shaping up to be a busy one. Apple will announce the latest versions of iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. The event could also include a trio of long-awaited hardware announcements, including a new Mac Pro, display, and MacBook Pro.\nApple\u2019s WWDC 2019 keynote is slated to kick off at 10AM PT/1PM ET. 9to5Mac will have complete coverage of the event and everything you need to know. What are you most excited to see? Let us know down in the comments.",

Users can send the app to an actual external display or even to an iPad.\nmacOS 10.15 will also include Screen Time, Shortcuts, expanded Apple Watch authentication, Apple\u2019s new \u201cFind My\u201d app, and more.\nRead our full roundup of macOS 10.15 features here .\nwatchOS 6\nFor Apple Watch users, watchOS 6 will include several notable enhancements. The update will reportedly include a host of new watch faces and complications, including new faces called \u201cCalifornia,\u201d\u201cGradient,\u201d\u201cX-Large,\u201d and more. New complications reportedly include ones for audiobooks, battery life, hearing aids, external noise measure, and rain data.\nAlso with watchOS 6, the Apple Watch will gain its own on-device App Store. Currently, the watchOS App Store is buried within the Apple Watch companion app on iOS, but watchOS 6 will finally bring a dedicated App Store to the device.\nOther new features in watchOS include a new Books app for audiobooks, as well as a new \u201cCycles\u201d health app for tracking menstrual cycles and \u201cDose\u201d for managing pill dosage and reminders. The Voice Memos app from iPhone will also reportedly come to watchOS this year as will a Calculator app.\nRead our full roundup of watchOS 6 features here .\ntvOS 13\nWhile we know quite a bit about watchOS, macOS, and iOS, it\u2019s unclear what enhancements tvOS 13 might bring. One possibility is that the update will include support for multiple user accounts. Apple TV+ will launch later this year, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see more tvOS enhancements at that time. Hardware\nWhile WWDC is generally software-focused, there is always the possibility of new hardware especially in 2019. Apple is said to have a trio of high-end Mac products in the works, including a new Mac Pro, a new external display, and a 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nMac Pro\nA Bloomberg report earlier this month said that Apple is \u201cconsidering\u201d debuting its new Mac Pro at WWDC this year. Not much is known about the new machine, with Apple saying that it will be \u201cmodular\u201d to allow for easy expansion and upgrade.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple debuted a new Mac Pro at WWDC. In 2013, Apple offered a preview of the trash can-style Mac Pro at WWDC, releasing it later that year. It\u2019s possible that Apple could do something similar this year, offering a brief teaser for the Mac Pro and promising a release by the end of this year.\nExternal Display\nIn conjunction with the new Mac Pro, Apple is also developing a new standalone display. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported that Apple is developing a 31.6-inch display with a 6K resolution. The display will feature miniLED technology as well as Night Shift, True Tone, HDR, and more.\nAs far as a release, Kuo has said that Apple is targeting a Q2 or Q3 release for the display. That aligns well with WWDC, so it certainly seems promising that Apple will unveil the display at WWDC this year. The new external display comes after Apple left the standalone display market in 2016 , discontinuing its Thunderbolt Display and pointing users towards third-party options.\nRead our full roundup of Apple display details here .\n16-inch MacBook Pro\nKuo has also reported that Apple is working on a new 16-inch MacBook Pro. This Mac is said to feature an \u201call-new design\u201d, and would also mark a new form factor altogether for the MacBook. Apple used to sell a 17-inch MacBook Pro, but for the last several years, the largest option has been the 15-inch model.\nA WWDC unveil for the 16-inch MacBook Pro is iffy \u2013 Apple just overhauled its MacBook Pro lineup with new processors this month. It\u2019s possible that the company simply didn\u2019t want that announcement to get buried at WWDC, but refreshing the MacBook Pro lineup in May and announcing an all-new machine in June would be abnormal for Apple. WWDC 2019 wrap-up\nThis year\u2019s WWDC is shaping up to be a busy one. Apple will announce the latest versions of iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. The event could also include a trio of long-awaited hardware announcements, including a new Mac Pro, display, and MacBook Pro.\nApple\u2019s WWDC 2019 keynote is slated to kick off at 10AM PT/1PM ET. 9to5Mac will have complete coverage of the event and everything you need to know. What are you most excited to see? Let us know down in the comments.",

      "text": "Permalink\nApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference is slated to kick-off on Monday, and it\u2019s shaping up to be one of the busiest years yet. At WWDC 2019, Apple will unveil iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13, and watchOS 6. There\u2019s also the possibility of new hardware and more. Read on as we roundup everything to expect at WWDC 2019. Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip Software\nAs is always the case, expect the main focus of WWDC this year to be on software. WWDC is Apple\u2019s opportunity to give developers a first-hand look at its new operating systems, giving them ample time to update their own apps ahead of public releases in the fall.\nApple will likely offer developer betas of watchOS 6, iOS 13, tvOS 13, and macOS 10.15 on June 3rd, the same day as its opening WWDC keynote. Public betas of each release will be available later in the summer, save for watchOS, which Apple does not offer to public beta testers.\nWhat can you expect from each of these updates at WWDC? Read on to find out.\niOS 13\niOS 13 is expected to include a wide array of new features. The most popular new feature for many people will be the long-awaited addition of a system-wide Dark Mode, which 9to5Mac exclusively offered the first look of this week .\nIn addition to Dark Mode, iOS 13 is expected to include a new \u201cFind My\u201d app that merges Find My Friends and Find My iPhone into a unified interface. This app will also include a \u201cFind Network\u201d feature that allows devices to be tracked even if they aren\u2019t connected to WiFi or cellular.\nThe iPad is expected to get a nice update with iOS 13 at WWDC. The update will add support for multiple windows of applications using a new \u201cdetachable panel\u201d style interface. Each window will be able to contain sheets that are attached to a portion of the screen but can be detached and moved around freely.\nAdditional rumored iPad enhancements include a revamped Home screen design and support for mouse input as an accessibility feature.\nOther new features in iOS 13 include a \u201cSleep Mode,\u201d updates to apps such as Reminders, Health, Home, and Books, Screen Time enhancements, a refreshed volume HUD, and more.\nRead our full roundup of iOS 13 features here .\nmacOS 10.15\nmacOS 10.15 is expected to focus heavily on Marzipan, Apple\u2019s technology for easily porting iPad apps to the Mac. Apple offered its first look at the technology last year, using it bring apps like News and Home to the Mac. Now, developers will also soon be able to use the technology to bring their own iPad apps to the Mac.\nThis year\u2019s macOS update will include a brand new Music app , which will be based on iTunes code but feature an all-new design with a focus on Apple Music.

      "text": "Google\u2019s Chrome is the most popular way to browse the web on desktop and mobile, thanks to a combination of features that make it a reliable, albeit sometimes resource-intensive, app. However, Google\u2019s recent moves are going to ruin the Chrome experience for many users, and we nearly missed them.\nGoogle a few months ago announced a proposal to change the way Chrome extensions work, which would prevent current ad blockers from working. Google received plenty of negative feedback from users, but this hasn\u2019t deterred the company from going forward with these plans.\nRelated Stories:\nApple, Google and Microsoft are fighting to keep your encrypted chats private\nIt sure looks like the Pixel 4 is getting an exciting redesign\nGoogle Maps now shows speed limits and speed cameras in 40+ countries\nGoogle a few days ago responded to some of the criticism (via 9to5Google ) regarding its Manifest V3 changes, explaining what will change going forward. The company confirmed that the ad blocking capabilities of Chrome would no longer be available to regular Chrome users. Chrome will still block content if you\u2019re a paid, enterprise user of Chrome.\nA Google\u2019s spokesperson told 9to5Google that \u201cChrome supports the use and development of ad blockers,\u201d adding that Google is \u201cactively working with the developer community to get feedback and iterate on the design of a privacy-preserving content filtering system that limits the amount of sensitive browser data shared with third parties.\u201d\nHowever, as the blog points out, the Chrome changes will make it impossible for most Chrome ad blockers to work in the near future. Google\u2019s moves aren\u2019t surprising, considering that it makes money from advertising. Alphabet noted in a recent SEC Form 10-K filing that ad blocking extensions are a \u201crisk factor\u201d to revenue:\nNew and existing technologies could affect our ability to customize ads and/or could block ads online, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed to make customizable ads more difficult or to block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality of third-party digital advertising. Most of our Google revenues are derived from fees paid to us in connection with the display of ads online. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that Google made it clear during I/O 2019 that it wants to offer better privacy and security to users, something that seemed to go against its bottom line. Google tried to redefine privacy to suit it needs around that time. The fact that it\u2019s trying to protect the customizable ads that it sells to businesses is also an indication that Google won\u2019t give up collecting user data anytime soon.\nIn Google\u2019s defense, we\u2019ll remind you the company is looking to improve the advertising experience on the web , and prevent the kind of annoying ads that you\u2019d use ad blockers to stop from appearing in the first place.\nAlso, in the same response, Google said that future versions of Chrome will make it easier for end-users to deal with permissions that extensions require and force developers to inform end-users of what data their extensions will access. The move is meant to protect privacy and prevent abuse, which is certainly laudable. However, that doesn\u2019t minimize the fact that Google plans to temporarily or permanently disable third-party ad blockers.\nBGR Top Deals:\nThis rugged, spill-proof Chromebook is so much more affordable than you thought This fast wireless charger works with any iPhone or Android, and it\u2019s only $7.95 Apple is finally going to put iTunes out of its misery Filming for the first MCU Phase 4 movie is already underway ",

      "text": "Your iPhone just got marginally more powerful, as 9to5Mac reports that Apple quietly increased its cellular download limit from 150MB to 200MB this week. If you aren\u2019t connected to Wi-Fi when you start downloading an app, movie, or podcast on your iOS device, it will check to see how large the file is. Previously, if a file was over 150MB, it would fail to download without connecting to Wi-Fi. But now the limit has been increased.\nRelated Stories:\nApple is finally going to put iTunes out of its misery\nNew leak shows off Apple's iPhone 11R design changes\nThe surprising main reason 492 out of 500 people at one company chose iPhone over Android\nThe cellular download limit makes sense on paper, as it stops unwitting users from downloading massive files and using up all of their monthly data on accident. On the other hand, the data limit is inexplicably impossible to override, so even if you recognize the risks and want to download the app or video anyway, you\u2019ll have to wait until you can find a Wi-Fi network. Even more baffling is the fact that wireless subscribers with unlimited data plans are restricted to the same data limit as everyone else, despite it serving them no purpose.\nThis would perhaps be an easier pill to swallow if Apple increased the limit on a regular basis, but as 9to5Mac points out, this is the first time the limit has changed since 2017 when it jumped from 100MB to 150MB.\nSo while it\u2019s not the most exciting news ahead of WWDC 2019 next week, it will be a welcome change for unlimited data customers who want a little bit of extra wiggle room for their over-the-air downloads. And with 5G right around the corner, perhaps a more substantial data limit will roll out in the coming years.\n This rugged, spill-proof Chromebook is so much more affordable than you thought Apple is finally going to put iTunes out of its misery Filming for the first MCU Phase 4 movie is already underway ",

      "text": "Apple will release a trio of new iPhones come mid-September, including the successors of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, as well as the brand new version of the iPhone XR. We\u2019re calling these devices iPhone 11 (XI), iPhone 11 Max (XI Max), and iPhone 11R (XIR?) for the time being, which sound like the logical names for the upcoming phones, although the iPhone clearly needs a less convoluted naming structure. The new phones are expected to feature the same design as the 2018 models when it comes to the notch display on the front side, with the main changes concerning the camera on the back. At least, that\u2019s what several leaks have told us so far, and we have more images that suggest the same thing.\nRelated Stories:\nYou can now download files up to 200MB over the air on your iPhone\nApple is finally going to put iTunes out of its misery\nThe surprising main reason 492 out of 500 people at one company chose iPhone over Android\nPosted on SlashLeaks Friday morning, the renders in the images below show purported designs for protective cases that would fit the 6.1-inch iPhone 11R.\nThe thing that stands out immediately is the square cutout on the back that\u2019s supposed to accommodate the phone\u2019s rear-facing dual-lens camera. The iPhone 11R is supposed to have two cameras on the back, according to reports. The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max are expected to feature three camera lenses on the back, but they\u2019re placed in a similarly shaped square module.\nConsidering that anybody could come up with renders based on existing reports, there\u2019s no way to verify this leak. Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear whether we\u2019re looking at concept iPhone case renders, or a finished product for the upcoming iPhone 11 generation. Of course, Apple won\u2019t tell anyone anything about new iPhones for well over three months. But as we get closer to the new iPhones\u2019 release date, we\u2019ll get more and more leaks, as these products hit production.\nIn the meantime, Apple will unveil iOS 13 on Monday during the WWDC 2019 opening keynote, offering us a glimpse at its mobile software vision.\nBGR Top Deals:\nCheck out this $30 pro controller instead of the $70 Nintendo Switch Pro Controller The Nintendo Switch\u2019s biggest design flaw can be fixed with this $10 accessory Marvel insider just leaked the first plot details for \u2018Doctor Strange 2\u2019 56 new Netflix original shows and movies will premiere in June \u2013 here\u2019s the complete list ",

      "text": "A little more than 18 years after Steve Jobs first introduced Apple\u2019s iTunes software at the 2001 Macworld Expo in San Francisco, pointing to a \u201cmusic revolution\u201d that was underway, Apple is reportedly planning to say goodbye to the app once and for all.\nThe new Music is expected to take over the syncing functions as well as the Apple device management that users previously relied on iTunes for. That\u2019s according to a new Bloomberg report, which said iTunes will be retired with the next major version of macOS.\nRelated Stories:\nYou can now download files up to 200MB over the air on your iPhone\nNew leak shows off Apple's iPhone 11R design changes\nThe surprising main reason 492 out of 500 people at one company chose iPhone over Android\nWe\u2019ve known things were heading in this direction for a while now, and now it seems the end of iTunes is finally at hand. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that iTunes on the Mac will be replaced with standalone versions of the Music, TV, and Podcasts apps, which makes sense \u2014 iTunes had become for many users a bloated shadow of its former self, with so many bells and whistles crammed into the app that many users have just ignored it altogether for years.\nJust a few days ago, we got our first look at what the new Music and TV apps will look like with the arrival of macOS 10.15 via leaked screenshots. This move by Apple, to use a trio of new apps (Music, TV, and Podcasts) to replace iTunes on the Mac follows Apple\u2019s same media app strategy on iPhones and iPads, Gurman reports.\nSo get ready to pour one out for iTunes, the music software that prefaced Apple\u2019s epic run from strength to strength starting in the early 2000s, and about which Steve Jobs said when the service was launched : \u201cApple has done what Apple does best \u2014 make complex applications easy, and make them even more powerful in the process. iTunes is miles ahead of every other jukebox application, and we hope its dramatically simpler user interface will bring even more people into the digital music revolution.\u201d\nApple, by the way, is expected to introduce new versions of its OS for iPhones and iPads, Macs, Apple Watch and Apple TV on Monday during the opening keynote for WWDC 2019. The event gets started at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, and we\u2019ll, of course, have coverage of all the news from the day.\n Check out this $30 pro controller instead of the $70 Nintendo Switch Pro Controller New leak shows off Apple\u2019s iPhone 11R design changes 56 new Netflix original shows and movies will premiere in June \u2013 here\u2019s the complete list ",

      "text": "Apple Plans End of iTunes, to Reveal Glimpses of Its Next Era of Apps and Devices Bloomberg 1 day ago Mark Gurman\n(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s developer conference beginning Monday will move the company closer to a future in which the iPhone is no longer the central cog for other products and services.\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook and other leaders will make a keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, to unveil updates of Apple\u2019s operating systems and a new approach to apps.\nThe changes will showcase Apple\u2019s new generation of devices and software: Apple Watches that are more independent from iPhones, iPads with software that reduces the need for a laptop, apps that run on any Apple device, and growth areas such as augmented reality and personal health-care management, according to people familiar with the plans.\nWhile the developer conference is software-focused, the company often sprinkles new hardware announcements in at the event. This year, Apple won't show off a new Apple Watch or iPhone hardware until the fall, but has considered previewing the new Mac Pro at the conference.\nWatch Independence When Apple launched the Watch in 2015, it was positioned as the next major product after the iPhone. But sales haven\u2019t reached iPhone levels and the Watch still relies on the handset. After adding cellular connectivity support to the device two years ago, the company will use its next software update, watchOS 6, to further break it free from the iPhone by adding an on-board App Store, new apps like a calculator and voice recorder, and new messaging features.\nRead more about what\u2019s coming up at this year\u2019s WWDC.\niPad as PC Replacement Apple has pushed the iPad as a laptop replacement for years. But many pro users have noted that while the hardware is capable enough, the software is still behind. WWDC will reveal new efforts to bridge that gap. The company plans enhancements to the home screen and new features around using multiple apps at once to help the iPad satisfy more of your computing needs.\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Key Speakers At The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) Unified App Strategy Developers will get new tools to build iOS apps for Mac laptops and desktop computers, essentially unifying Apple\u2019s app ecosystem. This follows last year\u2019s rollout of iPad versions of Apple\u2019s News, Voice Memos, Home, and Stocks apps on the Mac. The expectation is that single versions of all apps will eventually be able to run on every Apple device. As part of the shift, more underlying technologies will also merge.\n\u201cThe transition might not be finished for a couple of years, but this is the strongest push Apple has made toward the unification of its two platforms,\u201d said developer Steven Troughton-Smith. \u201cApple and developers can put more effort into one version of things instead of having to build everything twice.\u201d\nRead more about the combination of iPhone, iPad and Mac apps here.\n\u201cDevelopers can put more effort into one version of things instead of having to build everything twice.\u201d\nNew Apps Apple is also ensuring its own core apps are up to scratch after letting some languish in favor of system-wide features. The company is readying major revamps of the Reminders and Health apps and tweaks for Maps, Messages, Apple Books, Home, and Mail. It\u2019s also planning to merge Find my iPhone and Find my Friends into a single app.\nAugmented Reality Since getting into augmented reality in 2017, Apple has added new AR features to its iPhone and iPad software annually. But until Apple launches its AR glasses , the technology, which superimposes 3-D images over views of the real world, is unlikely to take off. At first, the headset will probably need an iPhone for certain tasks. Internal versions of iOS 13 have begun to add technology that supports a future headset, according to people familiar with its development. Apple is unlikely to talk about this publicly at WWDC, but the moves indicate the company is ramping up development of the glasses, which could be showcased as early as 2020.\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Key Speakers At The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) End of iTunes iTunes has been the way Apple users listen to music, watch movies and TV shows, hear podcasts, and manage their devices for almost two decades. This year, Apple is finally ready to move into a new era. The company is launching a trio of new apps for the Mac \u2013 Music, TV, and Podcasts \u2013 to replace iTunes. That matches Apple\u2019s media app strategy on iPhones and iPads. Without iTunes, customers can manage their Apple gadgets through the Music app.\nHealth Health care has become a fundamental part of many Apple products. For this year, beyond the revamped Health app for iPhones, the company will push into monitoring hearing health \u2013 how loud the external environment is and how loud you\u2019re playing sound on your device or headphones. It also plans more comprehensive menstrual cycle tracking on iPhones, and a pair of health apps for the Apple Watch: menstrual cycle tracking and pill reminders. There will also be a new Sleep Mode for Apple mobile devices and better support for hearing aids.\nTo contact the author of this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Apple will reportedly limit third-party tracking in children\u2019s apps The Verge 18 hrs ago Barbara Krasnoff While Apple has made some movement toward limiting ad tracking for its apps , the process isn\u2019t foolproof. This can be especially troubling when it comes to kids, who are more vulnerable to advertising and more likely to volunteer sensitive information. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal , Apple is planning to announce new limitations to third-party tracking for kids\u2019 apps, and the obvious opportunity for that is at Monday\u2019s 2019 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\nAd tracking is the process by which third-party companies \u2014 either app vendors or marketers associated with them \u2014 gather and share information about your browsing habits, phone, etc. This information can be used to specifically target your interests. For example, if you\u2019ve recently searched for sites about birds, you may start to see ads for binoculars. According to The Wall Street Journal \u2019s Joanna Stern, a children\u2019s iOS app called Curious World was sending info on her son\u2019s name, age, and books to Facebook. And while the company claimed it was a glitch, she and a colleague found trackers in 79 out of 80 iPhone apps.\nThere have been a number of recent reports about how much data is actually being passed on from iPhones to third parties. Geoffrey Fowler at The Washington Post found that his apps were sending out data to marketing companies \u2014 including his phone number and exact location \u2014 at night when they were supposedly dormant. In April, Apple caused some consternation among parents by placing a ban on apps that helped parents monitor what their kids can do on a phone.\nIt may be time for Apple to pay attention to its claims that privacy matters It may be time for Apple to pay attention to its claims that \u201cprivacy matters.\u201d (There are some things you can do right now to protect your privacy \u2014 at least to some extent. Check out our article on how to block ad tracking on your iPhone .)\nThere has been no confirmation from Apple about what its response will be. We will let you know if we hear from the company. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hopefully find out more during Monday\u2019s WWDC keynote.",

      "text": "There are so many exciting new Android smartphones coming in 2019. In fact, several of the best ones have already been released. After two years with the same design, Samsung completely overhauled the Galaxy S10 series and gave it a new all-screen design with a hole-punch camera that people seem to love. Then the OnePlus 7 Pro came along with the first true all-screen design and a selfie camera that pops up out of the top of the phone only when you need it. Of course, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there are even more exciting new Android phones set to be released over the course of the year, including the first crop of smartphones with OLED screens that actually fold so they can be made more compact.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the fence, there\u2019s not really anything terribly exciting about Apple\u2019s upcoming new iPhone 11 series smartphones. The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max will feature upgraded triple-lens cameras, which is certainly nice considering how far Apple has fallen behind market leaders like Huawei and Google. Beyond that, however, we\u2019re looking at new iPhone 11 models that look just like iPhone XS models from last year and the iPhone X from two years ago. And yet\u2026 despite how boring Apple\u2019s 2019 iPhone upgrade is shaping up to be, the companies unreleased iPhone 11 series smartphones still garner so much more hype than Android rivals. There\u2019s just something about Apple\u2019s iPhones that people can\u2019t seem to stay away from, and people are constantly trying to figure out exactly what it is. There are undoubtedly plenty of different reasons people have for choosing an iPhone over Android smartphones, but a new informal survey that was recently conducted suggested that one of the biggest reasons is something you would probably never expect.\nRelated Stories:\nYou can now download files up to 200MB over the air on your iPhone\nApple is finally going to put iTunes out of its misery\nNew leak shows off Apple's iPhone 11R design changes\nA Redditor who goes by the name \u201cjackharvest\u201d posted earlier this week in the Android subreddit to share an interesting story. He works in IT at an unnamed company, and his team noticed something crazy: of the 500 employees at the company, only 8 of them chose to use an Android phone. Everyone else \u2014 all 492 of them \u2014 chose an iPhone over Android phones.\nThe IT team was so intrigued that it decided to issue a survey to ask employees why they chose the iPhone over Android. According to the Redditor, more than half of the iPhone users at the company gave the same answer. Did they choose Apple\u2019s iPhone over an Android handset because the design and build quality are so much better? Was it because iPhones always outperform even the most powerful Android flagships in real-life speed tests? Or perhaps it was because they all prefer the simplicity and ease of use that iOS offers compared to Android.\nNope, it wasn\u2019t any of that. It was because they didn\u2019t want to be \u201cgreen bubbles,\u201d a reference to the fact that iMessage chats in the iPhone\u2019s Messages app use blue bubbles while SMS chats are displayed with green bubbles. Forget all of the great advantages iPhones might offer, iMessage is the main reason all these people wanted an iPhone. 98% of the employees at this company went with Apple over Android, and for the majority of them, it was mainly because of a single service.\nNow, commenters on Reddit were quick to point out that this phenomenon is unique to the United States and perhaps a handful of other regions, and they\u2019re correct. Cross-platform messaging apps from third-party app makers are popular in the US, but SMS and iMessage are still widely used. That\u2019s not the case in many other markets \u2014 SMS has been almost completely abandoned in favor of messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and others. The US is one of the biggest smartphone markets in the world though, and it\u2019s pretty crazy to think that the desire to be a blue bubble is still such a huge deciding factor for people here. Meanwhile, Google continues to flounder in all of its attempts to produce a similar messaging service for Android with anywhere near the kind of lock-in we\u2019ve seen with iMessage.\nBGR Top Deals:\nCheck out this $30 pro controller instead of the $70 Nintendo Switch Pro Controller The Nintendo Switch\u2019s biggest design flaw can be fixed with this $10 accessory Trending Right Now:\nMarvel insider just leaked the first plot details for \u2018Doctor Strange 2\u2019 This is what the Galaxy Note 10 will look like Marvel insider leaks the first plot details for \u2018Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u2019 ",

      "text": "Epicentre Holdings executive chairman and acting chief executive officer Kenneth Lim Tiong Hian has been uncontactable since May 24, the Catalist-listed former Apple reseller said on Thursday, after requesting a trading suspension that morning.\nEven as creditors are knocking on the former Apple reseller's doors, the Catalist-listed company said its proposed placement of up to 79.7 million new ordinary shares has fallen through as Mr Lim \"has been key and instrumental to the proposed placement\", according to a report in The Business Times.\nIt noted that it does not have any monies held in escrow.\n\"In order to repay the existing liabilities of the company, the company is currently trying to come up with a workout plan to facilitate repayment to creditors,\" said Epicentre. Having received statutory demands dated May 21 and May 27 from three creditors, Epicentre \"is seeking legal advice and assessing the potential impact on the group\".\n\"This potentially raises issues in terms of the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern,\" it added.\nLast year, Epicentre Holdings sold all four of its Epicentre stores to Elush (T3), which runs Apple reseller iStudio. It also granted Elush (T3) the licence to use its trademarks \"Epicentre\" and \"Live Out Loud by Epicentre\". Epicentre Holdings also owns 51 per cent of hair removal business Japan IPL, which has 10 outlets in Singapore.\nEpicentre said: \"In the absence of Mr Lim, the company remains under the leadership of the independent directors, who are considering all possible options in the best interests of the company.\"\nRelated Story Resellers reeling from tech giant Apple's expansion in Singapore Related Story Bad Apple business sends Epicentre into $7.1m full-year loss Related Story Debt-laden Newstead calls in liquidators amid debts of more than $60 million Related Story Uncontactable lawyer and missing $33 million: Allied Tech recuses three directors Separately, an independent review of Epicentre Holdings' 2017 financial year accounts has found \"governance and internal control issues\" regarding consultancy services agreements and a supply agreement in which Mr Lim was involved, as well as a breach of internal policy relating to a $1.76 million loan, which might have amounted to breaches of listing rules.\nAfter market close on Thursday, Epicentre provided an executive summary of the findings, noting that they were unrelated to the voluntary suspension of trading that day. \"The company has since taken steps to improve its internal controls and will keep shareholders updated on this via a further announcement in due course,\" it said.\nOn Oct 9, 2017, Epicentre announced that its auditor BDO had withheld its opinion on several matters in the company's FY2017 accounts, noting that it had not been given \"sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the veracity of the purported transactions\".\nEpicentre appointed Deloitte & Touche to conduct an independent review. One area of review related to the three agreements under which Epicentre provided consultancy services: one $1.4 million contract with LaVita (Thailand), later raised to $1.45 million; and two contracts with KT Pacific Group for a total value of $2.5 million.\nBoth firms were \"personal contacts\" of Mr Lim. The review noted a Mr Sy Meng Meng who is a director of KT Pacific and son of its controlling shareholder, and who also held a 6.42 per cent stake in Epicentre as at Oct 2, 2017.\nDeloitte & Touche said there \"have clearly been governance and internal control issues\" regarding these agreements. It noted that Epicentre's core business was in running IT retail outlets, and providing consultancy advisory was not part of its ordinary business.\nA second area of review was a supply agreement with Shenzhen Blueway Technologies, for an original contract value of $5.33 million with a discount of $888,000 if Epicentre made an advance payment of $4.44 million.\nThe advance was paid into two escrow agents, one of which was beneficially owned by Epicentre shareholder Leow Kok Meng, and the other by Mr Lim. The escrow agents, Mr Leow and Mr Lim also issued a performance guarantee for the benefit of Epicentre.\nHere, Deloitte & Touche also found \"governance issues and internal control issues\". The conduct of the supply agreement was \"irregular and unusual\", as Epicentre's funds were transmitted via Mr Lim and a shareholder.\nThe third and final area of review was a $1.76 million bridging loan taken on Sept 7, 2016, from Encore Investment Group, with a contracted interest rate of 24 per cent per annum, in order to meet payment obligations to Apple.\nOn Oct 27 that year, Epicentre entered a novation agreement to novate the loan to Mr Lim, with the only change being that the loan was now interest free.\nDeloitte & Touche said there was no formal consultation with the board prior to the loan's execution, amounting to a breach of internal policy.\n\u2022 Additional reporting by Melissa Heng",

      "text": "Breaking Friday, May 31, 2019 Home TECH NEWS iOS apps reportedly sharing massive amounts of data with tracking companies when you sleep iOS apps reportedly sharing massive amounts of data with tracking companies when you sleep May 31, 2019 TECH NEWS,\nEver since Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica data fiasco was exposed, users have become more aware and intersted in knowing how their data is collected and/or shared. Multiple companies are also touting to be more privacy centric now and Apple is one such conglomerate that has always expressed how it values user privacy and takes steps to ensure its users are protected. However, a new report by The Washington Post's Geoffrey Fowler sheds light on how iPhone apps are using trackers that users don\u2019t know about to send a high volume of user data to tracking companies. Fowler took help of the privacy firm Disconnect to test his iPhone, apps on which reportedly sent 1.5GB worth of personal information to tracking companies over a period of one month.\nIn the research, Fowler found that apps from some top companies were sending user data to tracking companies. These apps included Nike, Yelp, Spotify, Microsoft OneDrive, Mint, IBM\u2019s The Weather Channel, DoorDash, the crime-alert service app Citizen, and even The Washington Post's own iOS app. As per the report, over 5,400 trackers were encountered, mostly in apps, in one week of testing. Most of these trackers are said to work inconspicuously without the user knowing that they are running in the background and sending data. This data is then used to tailor and target ads at a user.\nAs for data being sent at night, the service is apparently activated when the phone is charging. The trackers are activated when there\u2019s less possibility of them interfering with other functions of the device. This is said to happen if one has enabled \u201cbackground app refresh\u201d function, which is enabled by default on an Apple device. DoorDash is a food-delivery service in California, US, and its app was found sending data to nine third-party trackers. On the other hand, an app for location-based crime reports called Citizen was found sharing Fowler\u2019s phone number, email and exact GPS coordinates with a tracker called Amplitude. The app was later updated to remove the Amplitude tracker, after its developers were contacted.\n\u201cFor the data and services that apps create on their own, our App Store Guidelines require developers to have clearly posted privacy policies and to ask users for permission to collect data before doing so. When we learn that apps have not followed our Guidelines in these areas, we either make apps change their practice or keep those apps from being on the store,\u201d Apple told The Washington Post in a statement. As the report points out, not all data collection is bad, especially when the data collected is anonymised and transiently stored. However, some of these trackers were collecting and sending data without disclosing what type of data is collected, for what duration it is collected and with whom it is shared. from Latest Technology News https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/ios-apps-reportedly-sharing-massive-amounts-of-data-with-tracking-companies-when-you-sleep-48305.html",

And your iPhone doesn\u2019t only feed data trackers while you sleep. In a single week, I encountered over 5,400 trackers, mostly in apps, not including the incessant Yelp traffic. According to privacy firm Disconnect, which helped test my iPhone, those unwanted trackers would have spewed out 1.5 gigabytes of data over the span of a month. That\u2019s half of an entire basic wireless service plan from AT&T. n a world of data brokers, Jackson is the data breaker. He developed an app called Privacy Pro that identifies and blocks many trackers. If you\u2019re a little bit techie, I recommend trying the free iOS version to glimpse the secret life of your iPhone. Yes, trackers are a problem on phones running Google\u2019s Android, too. Google won\u2019t even let Disconnect\u2019s tracker-protection software into its Play Store. (Google\u2019s rules prohibit apps that might interfere with another app displaying ads.)",

      "text": "May 29, 2019 macOS\nLikely the biggest of the announcements, Apple\u2019s operating system \u2014 macOS \u2014 is due to get a big shift this year in 10.15.\nLast year in 10.14 \u201cMojave\u201d, Apple not only gave users a dark mode , but a taste of what iOS apps might feel like on their laptops and desktops with News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and HomeKit, among others.\nThat was the beginning, and this year, we expect Apple will have its universal approach to cross-platform apps sorted.\nThe idea with this whole thing is to have apps that work across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, creating a sort of cross-platform continuity that works better for customers. Apple isn\u2019t alone in this approach, and Microsoft once envisioned the same for its Windows Phone environment to the Windows 10 desktop, but it never really worked well, and Windows Phone has since been killed off.\nApple therefore has a slightly better chance at pulling it off, and if it can achieve a system that helps developers build a single app that can run across several platforms, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll be able to take the apps you regularly rely on to your Mac, making an iPhone and a Mac a really solid proposition for folks keen to connect what they do, rather than solely rely on one device.\nDo you use Instagram, Snapchat, Pok\u00e9mon Go, and other apps that tend to work best on a phone? If successful, you should be able to bring those over to a MacBook or iMac, and it\u2019s a move that would also increase the app count available for Apple\u2019s App Store.\nApp platform unification is just one side of the changes expected, with another one possible in running an iPad screen as a secondary monitor.\nThere are already apps that do this on the Mac, but you usually have to pay extra to make them work, so if Apple brings this feature over, it could mean anyone with an iPad will be able to extend their screen real estate with an iPad to give themselves more room to work with. iOS\nNot to be left out, iOS is likely going to receive an update, and given the iPhone is arguably Apple\u2019s most successful and used operating system around the world, it\u2019s hardly a surprise.\nWith an expected launch of cross-platform apps on macOS, we kind of expect Apple to make this connection in iOS, as well, talking up what the whole thing will be able to do.\nAlongside that, there\u2019s talk of some interface improvements, one of which is a dark mode for the iPhone and iPad.\nDark mode came to macOS Mojave last year , and the idea is to darken the typically white or grey borders that make up the windows in the macOS operating system, helping to adjust your eyes when the light is lowered. It\u2019s not just for when the outside light is low, but also for folks who just prefer a darker interface, and there are plenty out there that do. Typically, that\u2019s what this user runs on Macs he reviews.\nThis year, you can expect dark mode to come to iPhones and iPads in iOS 13, with a way to view your phone in the dark that won\u2019t blind you with searing light.\nApple already supports TrueTone technology in many of its devices, and that helps to change the white balance and colour temperature of a screen to account for light around you, so in a way, an iOS dark mode would just really be an extension of that, helping your eyes in the process.\n\u201cHelp\u201d will likely be the name of the game for other features, too, because we\u2019re expecting some other helpful features to improve that work-life balance in iOS, though what they\u2019d be, we\u2019re not sure. There\u2019s already the excellent family modes, not to mention screen time which tracks your usage to tell you how you\u2019re going. What else could Apple add? We guess we\u2019ll find out next week. watchOS\nWe\u2019re not really sure what Apple will roll out for its smart watch, the Apple Watch, but more clock faces has to be on that list, something we gradually get a little more of each time.\nThough there\u2019s also something we\u2019re hopeful for, at least in Australia: support for using an Apple Watch as a transport pass.\nFor Sydney, that would bring the Opal pass to the Apple Watch and the iPhone, while Melbournites would ideally get Myki support.\nThis is pure speculation and hopefulness, mind you, but with something similar coming to folks in London in the near future , we have to be hopeful that Australians will see something similar shortly. tvOS\nThis is more of a hopeful list, because the rumours point more to the operating system of Apple TV in being a minor update this year.\nWith that in mind, we doubt there will be a major change from 4K to 8K, as it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Apple TV 4K gets Dolby Atmos with tvOS 12 , what Apple can bring that\u2019s new is a little low in number.\nShort of a few interface changes, we\u2019re not quite sure what tvOS updates will have in store.\nBut we\u2019re hoping for something: more screensaver control.\nIt seems a little crazy that for as powerful as the Apple TV is, you can\u2019t set the screensaver to any other apps. You can\u2019t, for instance, change it to your security cameras, nor can you shift it to any of the weather apps. You have photos and beautifully shot scenic videos, but that is largely it, and we\u2019re hoping that will change. New hardware\nThe least likely of the major WWDC announcements comes in the form of new major hardware, though the rumours are pointing to gear for professionals.\nSpecifically, gear for professionals with a decent amount of money and a need for customisation later down the track.\nApple\u2019s Mac Pro is still one very cool looking bit of kit, built for professional-types who need to get the fastest speeds in video editing, animation, and heavy processing work, but it\u2019s not very customisation friendly thanks to its unique hardware design. For a while now, Apple has been hinting at a hardware change with a new model, and at WWDC 2019, we might just end up seeing that, alongside an eventual release date, which would hopefully be later this year.\nAlmost two years ago, Apple released its pro-grade take on the iMac, which in some ways acted as a form of stop-gap for folks keen to see a new Mac Pro, but were happy to take it in the form of a screen. The iMac Pro is a good two years old at this WWDC, which should mean a more high-end Mac Pro is just around the corner.\nAnd it could come with a new screen.\nApple used to make some of the nicest screens around, but if you glance at the Apple website and look for an Apple monitor, you\u2019ll instead see LG\u2019s UltraFine 4K display touted instead.\nThere have been rumours that Apple would re-enter the display space for the longest time, and it would definitely make sense if it happened alongside a new Mac Pro.\nOf course, there\u2019s also a distinct possibility we\u2019ll see minor changes for other Mac hardware, too, and the one we\u2019re hoping gets a slight update is the MacBook, Apple\u2019s super thin and light machine that has been left alone since WWDC in 2017.\nThe MacBook\u2019s place is a little harder to place in the MacBook range at the moment, what with a more powerful MacBook Air that is similarly priced and not dramatically thicker or heavier competing for the same market share.\nIt\u2019s possible we could see the MacBook pushed to a lower price to compete for a more entry level machine, but frankly, we\u2019d just like to see an update all the same. Hardware that\u2019s two years old in the laptop world can begin to feel that way quickly, and so an update for this computer would be timed rather well during WWDC 2019. ",

Each year, Apple runs a WWDC scholarship programme, which gives students from around the world a free ticket to WWDC and a place to stay during the conference, so they get to partake in all the action.\nPhil Schiller, senior VP of worldwide marketing at Apple, puts this growth in student developers down to the creation of Swift, Apple\u2019s coding language, as well as the ease of publishing on the App Store. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing kids come into it with the most brilliant, creative ideas, ready to start their career in software,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd they bring so much enthusiasm and energy. When we do the keynote, there\u2019s about 6,000 people in the audience and you can immediately tell where the student section is because they\u2019re so loud. It\u2019s so nice to see.\u201d\nOf the 350 students making the trip to California this year, three of them are from London and Kent. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Spruce Campbell, 14 Spruce Campbell with his BAFTA Young Games Designer award in 2017 ( BAFTA )\nSpruce Campbell, from London, starting coding at the ripe young age of eight, after being inspired by the video games he was playing and took to designing new levels and concepts. Two years ago, he won the BAFTA Young Game Designer Award two years ago for one of his first apps, a game called CYBERPNK. A follow-up title, CYBER:JUMP , has received over 100,000 downloads on the App Store. What it takes to make a billion dollar mobile game\nHe says coding is like having a secret identity. \u201cIt always feels a bit surreal when I have to take a day off school to go to an event I\u2019ve been invited to.\u201d\nWhat he loves about the process though is the feeling he gets when something he\u2019s been slaving away at works. \u201cA lot of coding is solving puzzles and the feeling when the console clears all the errors, and you run it, and everything works is just as strong as what you feel when putting the final piece in a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d he says.\nThis is the first time Campbell will attend WWDC and he says he\u2019s tried to not read any of the rumours about what will be announced during the keynote.\n\u201cI\u2019m just as excited to be able to talk to some of the developers behind the apps I use every day. It\u2019ll also be really nice to catch up with all the friends I\u2019ve made over my coding journey so far.\" Aurther Nadeem, 15 Aurther Nadeem has two apps on the App Store already ( Aurther Nadeem )\nOriginally from Pakistan, Aurther Nadeem moved with his family to Kent when he was two years old. Like Campbell, he started coding at a young age and was about nine when he started using Scratch , a free programming language created by MIT.\nHe has two apps in the App Store already, both focused on maths: Quickk Maths and InComp . Why maths? \u201cThe App Store can be accessed in nearly every country in the world and hopefully through my apps people are getting access to a resource which can help them develop a better future for themselves and the people around them.\u201d From micro-scheduling to the three-task rule, the smart tech you need\nAt the moment he is balancing his school work around coding and hopes to study computer science at Imperial College in order to become a software developer. Attending WWDC is a dream come true after watching all the keynotes previously on his phone. \u201cActually being there will be a life-changing experience for me, \u201c says Nadeem. \u201cI hope to gain more knowledge and skills from the many opportunities that will be available there for all the scholars and hopefully I can implement these skills in my future work.\"\nHis big tech idea to save the world? \u201cI think one of the biggest difficulties at the moment is our struggles to harness renewable energy. I think we need to develop a piece of tech that allows us to fully harness the energy of the sun, similar to the conceptual Dyson sphere.\u201d George Taylor, 26 George Taylor has been studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples (George Taylor)\nGeorge Taylor, from Kent, says he was always interested in how tech works behind the scenes but it was only when he decided to apply for the Apple Developer Academy in Naples that he was able to explore this curiosity fully.\n\u201cI saw an article about the academy and that they were open for applications and I applied without thinking anything would come of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt turned out to be one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d How the Apple Watch ECG feature works\nCollaboration is a big part of the teaching at the academy so the first app Taylor worked on was with his classmates. Called Helium , it is an educational app using gamiefied learning to teach people about the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. \u201cI was mainly involved with the design of things but learned a lot from what the coders were doing. We built the app in about a week. It took a little more refining to push it to the App Store but it was a great feeling to put something out into the world.\"\nLike most Apple fans, Taylor says Steve Jobs is one of his tech heroes but he also has a lot of respect for Susan Kare, who designed most of the icons for the original Mac. \u201cIt is such an art to be able to abstract things into a simple and intuitive part of a user interface that people can identify with. Her work has defined a lot of what iconography has become in software today.\u201d\nAt WWDC, Taylor hopes to meet more of the global iOS developer community as well as see all the action live at the keynote. The end of his time at the academy is fast approaching but he has some big plans. \u201cThe dream would be a job at Apple but I would also be excited to take forward a couple of app ideas with some friends from the Academy in a start-up.\u201d\nWWDC 2019 runs from Monday June 3 - to Friday June 7.

Also, content previously purchased through iTunes will now be managed through its new corresponding app.\nThis news is just one of many updates released ahead of Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. that is taking place on June 3. More details will likely be unveiled at that time.\nIn the meantime, pour one out for iTunes tonight. It was quite a revolutionary ride that helped build the digital era of music that exists today.\nErica Banas is rock/classic rock news blogger that loves the smell of old vinyl in the morning.

      "text": "If there\u2019s one theme that seems to be driving Apple\u2019s approach toward its Mac software, it\u2019s bringing popular mobile features to its desktop operating system.\nApple is expected to debut its next major Mac operating system update during its Worldwide Developers Conference conference on Monday, and reports indicate it will include some iPhone and iPad-centric features. The biggest of these is said to be the ability to run iPad apps on Apple\u2019s desktop computers.\nApple will likely provide a preview of the software on Monday before launching the new update in the fall, as it has done in years past.\nHere\u2019s a look at what we\u2019re expecting to see from the update, which will presumably be called macOS 10.15.\nDevelopers will be able to make iPad apps that run on the Mac.\nSoon enough, you may be able to run iPad apps on your Mac laptop or desktop. The move, reportedly called \u201cMarzipan\u201d internally, will enable developers to write apps for both operating systems using the same code, according to Bloomberg .\nApple previously mentioned the effort in a presentation at last year\u2019s WWDC, and news of the project was reported by Bloomberg as far back as 2017.\nIt would be a significant change that could make both the iPad and Apple\u2019s Mac computers more useful. Apple has been pushing the iPad as being a productivity tool ever since it launched its larger-screened iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.\nBut one of the biggest criticisms in using the iPad in place of a laptop is that the software isn\u2019t as well-optimized for certain tasks as desktop operating systems. Allowing developers to easily create apps for both could potentially change that.\nIt also echoes the approaches taken by Microsoft and Google with their mobile and desktop products. Developers can write apps that work across Windows 10 tablets and laptops, and Google has made its mobile Android apps compatible with Chromebooks in recent years.\nApple will bring more of its mobile apps to the Mac, too.\nApple will also reportedly bring a handful of its own iPhone and iPad apps to the Mac with the macOS 10.15 update, according to Bloomberg. These could include:\nThat includes a new Apple Music app.\nMacOS 10.15 is expected to include a new Apple Music app, according to 9to5Mac and Bloomberg .\nThe design for this new app will be based on iTunes, and it\u2019s expected to feature similar user interface elements such as a gray side menu where options like the \u201cFor You\u201d section and \u201cBrowse\u201d feature are located, as leaked screenshots published by 9to5Mac indicate.\nAnd the new Apple TV app.\nApple said in March that its new Apple TV app will debut on the Mac this fall, which means there\u2019s a good chance it will be included in macOS 10.15.\nThe new app, which is already available on Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad, brings a handful of changes, the biggest of which being the ability to subscribe to specific channels like HBO and Starz, from within the app. The app has also received a cosmetic redesign that brings deeper personalization.\nOther iPhone features are expected to make their debut on the Mac as well.\nApple is also expected to bring other recently-introduced iPhone features to the Mac this fall, according to Bloomberg. These include:",

      "text": "Over the last few years, the way we consume music has drastically changed. Instead of purchasing albums, many people choose to pay for a subscription to a music streaming platform where they can listen to pretty well anything they want for a fixed cost. This has led to lower physical sales for albums, with streaming numbers accounting for the vast majority of album sales. For those who did purchase and download music, iTunes became a necessary application as it allowed you to sort and organize your music library. Well, if you had an attachment to iTunes, you'll have to say goodbye very soon as it has been announced that Apple will discontinue the service, according to Pitchfork .\nBased on the report, it appears as though Apple is looking to replace iTunes with specialized individual apps for Music, Movies, and Podcasts. These apps are slated to be announced at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, which will be in just a few days on Monday, June 3rd.\nIt is being reported that the music app will let its users manually sync their devices, which will surely be a welcomed feature for many who opt to use the new app.\nAre you disappointed to see iTunes go or have you hopped onto the streaming wave already?\n",

      "text": "Shares of industrial and transportation companies fell after President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on Mexico that could disrupt factory supply chains.\nThe Trump administration proposed slapping 5% tariffs on Mexican imports -- nearly $360 billion a year of trucks, cars, vegetables and other goods -- starting June 10 unless Mexico stems the flow of undocumented migrants to the U.S. If components are included, the value of goods crossing the border is even higher.\n\"Tariffs start small, but could get multiplied for auto parts,\" said strategists at Swiss bank UBS. \"The effect on the auto industry is critical.\"\nShares of Ford Motor fell by more than 2% while General Motors was down by more than 4%. GM counts on Mexico as both a market for its products and a location for its factories.\n\"Just as Caterpillar along with the semiconductor stocks and Apple are proxies for the U.S.-China trade war GM is a proxy for Mexican-U.S. trade,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\nRob Curran, rob.curran@dowjones.com",
